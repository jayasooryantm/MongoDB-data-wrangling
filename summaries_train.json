third wave was an experimentto see how people reacted to a new one leader government. It gained popularity as people wanted to try new things. The students follow anything that is said and start turning on eachother to gain higher power. They had to stop the experement as too many people got to radical with it blindly following there leader","1":"They would rub it up with soda to make the smell go away and it wouldnt be a bad smell. Some of the meat would be tossed on the floor where there was sawdust spit of the workers and they would make the meat all over again with the things in it.","2":"In Egypt, there were many occupations and social classes involved in day-to-day living. In many instances if you were at the bottom of the social ladder you could climb up, you didn't have to stay a peasant you could work to bring your status up. Everyone worshipped the gods Ra, Osiris, and Isis, but also they would worship their pharaohs like gods as well. Under the pharaohs were the priests, they had the responsibility to entertain or please the said god. The Chain of Command was placed to keep everyone in check, not one person could handle all the civilians and treasures without any aid. Like the tax collector, called a vizier like stated they were in charge of collecting the peoples' tax. They were also one of the rare instances who were able to read and write, that's how they were granted \"vizier\" Also the soldiers did many things as they would fight in wars or \"quelled domestic uprisings\". They were in charge of getting the slaves, farmers, and peasants to build palaces or the famous ancient pyramids. More skilled hardworking workers had occupations of craftsmen or women and physicians. This would mostly make up the middle-class people. The creative craftsmen would often make jewelry, papyrus products, pottery, tools, and many useful things people may need . Of course, you would need merchants to sell the goods to people who would pay for it.","3":"The highest class was Pharaohs these people were gods.Then the 2nd highest class was a gonvener.Chiefs minister were called a vizier as a supervisor. (par.6)","4":"The Third Wave developed  rapidly because the students genuinly believed that it was the best course of action. Their grades, acomplishments, and classparticipation\/ behavior had improved dramatically since the experiment began. There did not seem to be any consiquenses in the students eyes. They became extremely engaged in all the Third Wave activites both inside and outside tha classroom. The experiment ended because the students were so patriotic about the \"movement\". The history class of thirty rapidly grew to 200 in three days.  That means 170 students joined a school \"movement\" in two days. Thats 85 people per day! On the fifth and final day all the students had completley believed that the \"Third Wave\" was a movement that would expell democracy. They believed a candidate from the \"movement\" would anounce its existance on television after five days of its success. The creater, Ron Jones, believed it had gone too far and for everyone's safety he shut it down.  If he hadn't the fake organization would have grown into something out of his controll. The Third Wave only lasted for a week. It could have spiralled into the American version of the Nazi Party, which is the opposite of what America stands for.","5":"They would use chemicals and substances to change the color or hide the foul odors to cover up spoiled meat. They would also shred up spoiled and normal meat together into sausage and use many different substances to mask the signs of spoiling.","6":"The Egyptian society is really different from other socicties I have learned about. As stated in the story in paragraph 6-13 it describes how people are in different places in the pyramid.

It also says \"Skilled workers such as physicians and craftsmen\/women made up the middle class\" (USHistory.org 12). This shows that the the upper part of the government just lives off of the farmers and everything else. If they stoped working it would all crumble.

Since the sudents in the experiment were so obedient, they followed these orders. As a result, more students joined the movement, not neccessarily because they agreed with the idea, but because so many people were part of it (herd behavior). This lead to the ending of the experiment because it had gotten out of control.

This means that the story follows the actions and resolution of the main character only, and focuses on the character's change of fortune froom good to bad. Another element most crucial to a tragedy is that the plot must incite both fear and pity for all who watch the play. If the play ends with a \"feel good\" moment, then it has failed as a tragedy, as it doesn't incite fear and pity. The purpose of tragedy is not to  satisfy some moral sense, but to inspire feelings appropriate to witnessing a tragedy, to experience a \"cleansing\" of watching someone else suffer.  Lastly, an ideal tragedy must have a protagonist that is not overly righteous or holy, but is not depraved; the character is somewhat middle of the road.  By having the character behave in this way it makes the story more realistic and true, making the character's journey that much more engaging for the audience.  When the audience sees a tragic event occur to a plausible character because of a mistake or slight misfortune, the feeling of tragedy is heightened because it seems more true.","59":"They would rub meat with soda to take away the foul smell, put pickles inside of the ham to also hide the smell of the odor, the smell of spoiled ham was strong.","60":"The would use chemicals and science.  \"old sausage that had been rejected, and that was moldy and white \u2013 it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption\"","61":"The structure of the ancient Egyptian system of government is working with the vizier were scribes who kept government records.

The skilled workers also consisted of physicians and craftmen\/women. At last were the slaves and farmers.

Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war.\"","103":"According to Aristotle, there are three elements of an ideal tragedy. These are, a perfect tragedy should be arranged not on the simple but on a complex plan, so the plot. Then, there is character. Aristotle says, \"Then remains, then, the character between these two extremes-- that of a man who is not eminently god and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty.\" The third element should be spectacle.

Mr. Jones decided to terminate the movement because it was getting out of contro.

The main reason the experiment ended was because it got way out of hand and the teacher thought it was getting to powerful so he needed to stop it.","111":"In the story ''Egyptian Social Structure'' it was about people who kept government records and nobles that could hold governements post. Different social classes were involved because the famers had to pay taxes, soilders were included, carftsmen, people paying for their kids education  and etc.. I know this because in paragraph 3 and 5 it says,'' Each farmer paid taxes in the form of grains, which were stored in the pharaoh\u2019s warehouses. This grain was used to feed the people in the event of a famine.'' and '' Working with the vizier were scribes who kept government records. These high-level employees had mastered a rare skill in ancient Egypt \u2014 they could read and write.''

Slaves worshiped the higher classes. Obviously, slaves were the slaves.  Farmers were farmers. Soldiers fought the battles. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods. Nobles held government posts. Viziers were tax collectors, info gatherers, Pharoah advisers, etc. And last but not least, Pharaohs were the kings\/rulers. People thought they were gods so they praised them.","113":"the ancient egyptions are different from social classes because the classes are classes used to teach and do arts and craft because they also have many ancient egyption people.","114":"To cover up spoiled meat the meat packing industry would color the meat and cover it in chemicals.

The students also recruited new members, which made the experiment grow extremely quickly. Mr. Jones had to stop the experiment because he felt as though it was slipping out of his control, and the students had become extremely involved and loyal to the project.","117":"One of the ways that the meat factory would cover up spoiled meat was that they would put chemicals on the meat to hide the odor. \"How they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters.\" Using baking soda to cover the smell of things is gross, they also used pickle juice.","118":"At the begining of the second paragraph it says \"they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell\" it also says \"of all the miricles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose.\"","119":"    Companies would put chemicals on it or mix the spoiled meat with other meat. The text states, \" ...it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption.\" This specific part is talking about the moldy white sausage that Europe had rejected and these companies used.","120":"In paragraph two, it says they would pump hams with spoiled meat. The smell was so bad they found a way to mask it and sell their \"boneless hams\". In paragraph three, they show how they took in moldy,  white sausages from Europe. They later dosed these sausages with borax and glycerin then remade to sell.","121":"The meat packing industry would commonly just mix in bad meat with good meat to make sausage and call it a day or rub some borax in it. Because the good meat countered the smell and the looks enough, it was hard to tell on the shelfs. Sometimes they would even sell spoiled meat for more money because of the coloring and borax put into it.","122":"The Third Wave was developed by Jones who proceeded to enforce strict classroom discipline by emerging as an authoritarian figure. Jones\u2019 class was transformed into a group with a supreme sense of discipline and community. Jones was surprised that some of the students started reporting to him when other members of the movement failed to abide by the rules. The students became increasingly involved in the project and their discipline and loyalty to the project was so outstanding that Jones felt it was slipping out of control.  He decided to terminate the movement, so he lied to students by announcing that the Third Wave was a part of a nationwide movement and that on the next day a presidential candidate of the movement would publicly announce its existence on television. instead of a televised address of their leader, the students were presented with a blank channel. After a few minutes of waiting, Jones announced that they had been a part of an experiment to demonstrate how people willingly create a sense of superiority over others, and how this can lead people to justify doing horrible things in the name of the state\u2019s honor.","123":"In Eygt,  the slave was on last of the soicial pyramid  and the pharos were o the top.

The very top of the pyramid was the gods and the pharaohs because the gods controlled the universe and because the pharaohs were believed to be able to comunicate with the gods so they were thought as god like. The gods controlled the universe and the pharaohs controlled everyone. The priest and nobles were next. Only nobles could hold government office. The priest were supposed to make the gods happy. After nobles and priest came the soldiers. The soldiers were the ones that fought in wars or quelled domestic uprisings. Soldiers were also the ones who supervised the peasants, farmers, and slaves who were involved in building such structures as pyramids and palaces. The people who were next after soilders were scribes. A scribe recorded in writing the everyday life and extraordinary happenings in ancient Egypt. Their jobs were varied and included writing letters for fellow villagers who couldn't write, recording the amount of crops harvested. After the scribes came the merchants. Egyptian merchants carried products such as gold, papyrus made into writing paper or twisted into rope, linen cloth, and jewelry to other countries. Next after merchants were artisans. Artisans created the fine artwork that often covered temples, royal tombs, and other monuments. They worked in large groups to complete engravings, paintings, and hieroglyphics. Despite artisans' skill and creativity, the upper classes often viewed them as little more than common laborers. Next after artisans were farmers. Now we're on to the lower part of the pyrimad with farmers. Farmers are the ones who harvest food. They also harvest papyrus for others(most likely scribes) to write on. Now we're on the VERY bottom of the social pyrimad with slaves and servants. The servants worked as cooks, butlers, litter carriers, and as pharaoh's dressers. The male servants also worked on royal building projects or were sent to fight in the Egyptian army. Egyptian servants did not have many rights but were usually not treated poorly. Egyptian servants could not own or inherit land. Slaves were very important in ancient Egypt as a big part of the labor force, but they were also used for many other purposes. Many slaves were house servants, gardeners, farm labor, musicians and dancers of excellent talent, scribes, and accountants.","128":"an ideal tragedy should have a conflict the reader can relate to the readers emotion.

The factory usally just chopped the spolied meat into sausages and resold them.  A lot of the times the spolied meat would be mixed with half a ton of other meat even if it had been on the floor and had rat dung on it. ","138":"Meat packing industrees had many ways to get customers to buy the rotten, or spoiled meat. One of the ways the employees would conceal the rotten meat was by rubbing soda on it. The soda would cover, or get rid of that smell. Uptown Sinclair says \"Jonas had told them how the meat that was taken out of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters.\" The meat packing industries were so desperate to make money and strive in buisness that they would sell anything, no matter the condition. In the Jungle it also says \"and fancy skinned hams  which were made of the oldest hogs, whose skins were so heavy and coarse that no one would buy them-that is, until they had been cooked and chopped fine and labeled head cheese\" The meatpacking industries would do many things to excell in buissness; other processes they developed were called \"boneless hams,\" and also \"California hams.\"  In conclusion, Meat packing industrees had many ways to get customers to buy the rotten, or spoiled meat.","139":"     The Third Wave devoped over such a short time from people blindly followin his rules and students trying to get people to join the movment.

The farmers had to tend the fields, raised animals, kept canals and reservoirs in good order.Each farmer had to pay taxes in the form of grains.This proves why the  slave and the farmer is no where as good as being a pharaoh and that is why it is at the bottem of the list.

The entire point of tragedy is to invoke a deep and true feeling of pity or sadness in the reader, something they can relate to on some level. a man going from rich to poor does not invoke these feelings, and neither does a man going from rags to riches. Villians falling and heroes rising cause opposite emotions than what is to be striven for in a tragedy, so a true tragedy has to have a merely ok character, usually with a moral compass that is skewed. As the focus on this one mediocre man, they shouldn't be taken on tangents that stray from the one main topic of the story of this man. A tragedy written to please the readers like The Odyssey, oftentimes more resembles the plot of a comedy than a tragedy. We have been able to infer from this article that a good tragedy follows at least 3 very important elements, 1) it follows the story of a neither good nor evil man, 2) it has many events of sadness and none of success 3) it follows one main plotline that wouldn't be easily confused with that of another genre.

Scribes were also at the same levels as viziers they were important because they knew how to read and write.  Underneath them are nobles and priests. In the text, it states that \"Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods\" which was important because they thought that all their successes were only possible with luck and help from the gods.  Soldiers were also important they fought in battles to help protect their people but also work part-time as supervisors of peasants as well as farmers and slaves.  Craftsmen were in charge of making many things such as \"jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, tool, and other useful things.\" this was important because without those things they wouldn't be able to trade or make advancements in technology.

The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. \" (Paragraph 3) which tells the reader that it should be a change that is drastic and shocking.

In the text, it states \"Cut up by the two-thousand-revolutions- a-minute flyers, and mixed with half a ton of other meat, no odor that ever was in a ham could make any difference.\" These are all ways that the factory would try to cover up the spoiled meat.

Another thing that Aristotle says that would make for a good poem or plays would be not to arrange it in a simple form. He says that it should be more complex for it makes it more interesting. If it is more simple it will have more of a plain mood to it. The last thing that Aristotle mentions is that when you are trying to make a tragedy don't try to give it comical ending. He says that in the Odyssey the makers tried to make it to where the most deadliest enemies were friends. He is simply stating that making the worst of enemies friends gives it more of a comical mood to it instead of having the tragic like theme going on.","274":"They would pump with pickle adn rub it with soad. \"Jonas had told them how the meat that was taken out of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters\".

Also in the text it states, \"Jonas had told them how the meat that was taken out of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters\" this shows that they sold spoiled meat to free lunch counters.

For example, the vizier collects tax. According to paragraph 4, it states, \"  The pharaoh appointed a chief minister called a vizier as a supervisor. The vizier ensured that taxes were collected.\" This conveys that he helps collect the tax for the pharaoh. This shows that he is helping out by collecting the tax and giving it to the pharaoh. Secondly, the priest helps out because he collects tributes for the god. According to paragraph, 6 it states, \". Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods.\" This signifies that they had to keep to god happy and pleased. If they didn't keep him happy bad things could happen to them. Finally, craftsmen were in charge of making jewelry and many more things. According to paragraph 9, it states, \"Craftsmen made and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, tools, and other useful things.\" This shows that they made many useful things that were used on a daily basis.

The kids in Mr. Jones class were all of the sudden so disciplined and motivated to follow their orders. Once Mr. Jones told them that they need to salute eachother in and outside of the class people from outside of his class decided to join in. The experiment was ended because it was starting to get out of control and students were getting completely involved in this experiment.","346":"The first element is a man who is highly renowed and prosperus.

In paragraph 2 it says \"Jonas had told them how the meat that was taken out of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters;...\" This quote shows a way that they tried to mask the rotting sent of the meat to give it away for human consumption. ","349":"ONe important aspect of a tragedy is it should be simple and people should be able to relate to it. The tragic hero should fall fro great heights, and should not be the reverse. Tis trasnsformation should brng out fear and pity, so the audience is on edge. ","350":"The meatpacking factory used some disgusting practices to cover up spoiled meat.  One way they covered up spoiled meat was rubbing soda to take away the smell, and then they would sell it to be eaten, the author stating, \"The meat that was taken out of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters.\" (Sinclair 2). Another way the factory would \"give them thirty per cent\", which was using 2 rounds of a pickling to destroy what was described as \"an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them.\" (Sinclair 2). One way they used odd sources for their 'meat' was by extracting bone. Another odd source was the knuckles, joints, and all meat. The author states, \"The packers were always originating such schemes- they had what they called \"boneless hams\", which were all the odds and ends of pork stuffed into casings; and \"California hams\", which were the shoulders, with big knuckle joints, and nearly all the meat cut out.\" (Sinclair 2).","351":"      The Egyptian hierachy consisted of the pharoh (a god in human form) the scribes, priests, middle class and the slaves.

The slaves where forced to do work for the pharoh, scribes and priests based off what I read in   section Bottom Of The Heap","352":" Factories use a varties of ways to use and cover up spoiled meat.  Packingtown Swindles, a notable company in the swindle industry allegedly took spoiled meat and turned it into sausages or canned it for consumer consumptio. Jonas, a insider studying the spoiled meat industry has said, \"For it was custom, as they found, whenever meat was so spoiled that it could not be used for anything else, either to can it or else to chop it up into sausage.\"  Another way they dealt with spoiled meat was to cut it up and combine it with various other meat. One such quote  in the Jungle states, \"the whole ham was spoiled... cut up by the two thousand revolution... and mixed with half a ton of other meat,\".  As you cano see now vividly the meat industry back in the 1800s-1900s was malicious and many meat were barley edible and some downright vomiting.","353":"The Third Wave developed in such a short time because it proved that people always follow a crowd even if it has bad intentions.  The experiment on the students was used as a way to prove that if Jones ordered his students to perform strict tasks, others would follow. For example, \"As the week went on, Jones\u2019 class transformed into a group with a supreme sense of discipline and community. The class expanded from initial 30 students to 43 attendees.\" (paragraphs 2 and 3). This shows how the experiment was a success because students began to follow orders. The experiment was ended because Jones believed it started to get out of hand when students began to become increasingly involved with the project and their discipline and loyalty to it was outstanding.

They believed that their pharaohs were gods. This is why they were on top of the social classes.  Powerful nobles and priests are right below pharaohs. They were the only ones that are able to hold government posts.  Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods. The nobles were wealthy from the donations they got from the gods. Soldiers supervised the people who were involved in buildings (pyramids and palaces). Skilled workers are in the middle of the social classes. They make or do useful things. The bottom of the social classes is slaves and farmers.  Different social classes have different jobs surrounding the government.

However, Jones ended up terminating the experiment due to how shocking their discipline and loyalty had become.

They chop it up into sausages.When ham is spoiled that it came into the deparment of Elzbieta. I paragraph !, it states that \", whenever meat was so spoiled that it could not be used for anything else, either to can it or else to chop it up into sausage. This shows that thats what they do when it is spoiled.","372":"The different ways the factories would use and cover up  spoiled meats were by cutting the left over or spoiled meat into little pieces so that they could make sausages out of them, they would use chemicals to take away the smell of the meats, and they would pickle some meats that smelled really bad, and they would only bring in spoiled ham into the department of Elzbieta, sausages that were moldy and white would be dosed in borax and glycerin and then chopped up again to make them over again, they would put dead rats, poisoned bread and rat poop in the hoppers that made the sausages, they would clean their dirty hands in the water that was used for the sausages.","373":"Three elements of an ideal tradegy described by Aristotle would include a \"complex plan,\" something that \"imitates actions which excite pity and fear,\" and have a character \"who is not eminently good and just.\" With all of these things together, you should be able to create a goof tragedy that maintains unity of plot.

After pharaohs died, huge stone pyramids were built as their tombs. Pharaohs were buried in chambers within the pyramids.","375":"The structure of the ancient Eqyptian system of government has the different social groups involved in a couple ways.  For one, the slaves and farmers were at the bottom of the social structure so they were treated like garbage. Like in paragraph 11 it says \"slavery became the fate of those captured prisoners of war. In addition to being forced to work on building projects, slaves toiled at the discretion of the pjaraoh or nobles.\" So this shows that because they were at the ottom of the social structure they were the slaves and basically they were props that once they were no longer neeeded they were disposed of. Second of all, in paragraph 6 it says \"Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions they profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh. Priests were reesponsible for pleasing the gods.\" So this shows that becasue they had more power they were the only ones who could have a government position. Which means that they have a whole lot of power. So to conclude, the structure of the ancient Egtian system of government has the social groups involved in a couple ways.","376":"The expriment grew so huge so fast because the teacher got a decent crowd to follow him, and pressure from the crowd made even more join, and it ended by the teacher because it was way to effective.","377":"All the students felt a sense of pride and unity over the third wave as it gave them a sense of belonging and most likely alot of peer pressure.

The meat was also left in bad conditions, where they would leave the meat in cellars and old barrels, where rats would run on it. To make the meat look fresh, they would \"call upon their chemistry department, and preserve it with borax and color it with gelation to make it brown.\" (Sinclair 5). Even if the meat was white and moldy, and had terrible odors, they would put chemicals on it to make it appear fresh and edible.","382":"One of the elements of an ideal tragedy by Aristotle is arousing pity and fear among the audience. Another element of tragedy includes the character's misfortune that is caused by an \"error of judgement\" or weakness, and not by vice. An ideal tragedy should have the character be prosperous and well-known by others, too.","383":"Aristotle describes an ideal tragedy as one that should be arranged on a complex plan, imitate actions that help portray pity and fear, and possess no single tragic quality. ","384":"They would rub soda to hide the smell. The use of pickle, borax, gelatin were to peserve and cover up spoiled meat.

","387":"three elements that described Aristotle are first it's not arranged simple but it is on a complex plan. then, it changed of fortune should be not from bad to good. later on, it would be on the opposite catastrophe for the good and for the bad.","388":"Three elements of an ideal tragedy should include but are not exclusive to having a complex plot, not explicitly present both the virtuous and non-virtuous aspects of man, and should reverse the fortune from good to bad. These three elements are supported in the second paragraph of the text saying, \"A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan...It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity...it should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or fraility....\" The first element means that there should be depth to the story, one that is complex and filled with curiousity which will excite the reader. The second element suggests that the impact on the readers should not be shown through a virtuous man's downfall and hardships simply because that doesn't show compassion or fear. The last elemeny suggests that the outcome of the character be bad instead of the traditional good. A tragedy is meant to show the negatives that have lead to the downfall. It isn't meant to be happy and satisfy the reader. It is mean to teach a moral that leave the reader simply content, neither happy nor sad.","389":"Cause pity and fear in the audience, a person not evil or good to fall because of a mistake, and there should never be a downfall of the villain shown.","390":"An ideal tradegy described by Aristotle is known to have a complex plan, known to exite pity and fear, and have a character that is not eminently good and just. Aristolte describes the complex plan as something that shocks the audience and follow the fotune of good to bad. The complex plan also incorparate double thread plots which can include an opposite tradgedy.  An example of the double thread plot is the Odyssey. When a tradegey exites pity and fear, it usually starts with a change of fortune. In the text it says, \"... that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity.\" This part merely shocks the audience. Finally, a tragic hero is a man that is not bad but not perfect. There is always an error of judgement or flaw. In the text it says, \"He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous \u2014 a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such families.\" These type of characters started out on the top which causes their tragic journey to go downhill. These are the elements of a tradegy described by Aristotle.","391":"\"A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan.\" Meaning it should have depth and meaning to it. ","392":"The three elements that Aristotle believed a tragedy should \" imitate actions which excite pity and fear\", it should be a \" complex plan\", and that \" some error of judgment or frailty\".","393":"According to Aristotle, an ideal tragedy consists of a variety of elements: plot, character, action, diction, thought, spectacle, and song (music), however, the first three are most significant. Aristotle's main points help readers to understand tragedies, \"A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain. The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse.\"  In contrast, character displays men's qualities, \"the character between these two extremes \u2014 that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous \u2014 a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such families.\" The purpose of action in the tragedy, is not the representation of character. Without action there cannot be a tragedy, however, there may be one without character, \" It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation.\"","394":"\"The Egyptians also elevated some human beings to gods. Their leaders, called pharaohs and  that they had a lot of power over serten things, after the pharaohs died they did a huge stone pyramids. The Pharaohs were baried in a chamber in the pyramids. ","395":"There are many social classes like from the top we have pharaohs then on the bottom we have slaves. Pharaohs were treated as gods they believes they were important and so they worshiped there pharaohs. But next is nobles and preists they both gave stuff to the gods as the noble controls the most. visers and scribes are different scribes read and write visers collect taxes and help the pharaohs. Farmers and slaves farmer just farm and pay taxes as slaves they do things against there will.","396":"According to Aristotle,  the 3 elements of an ideal tragedy have to do with the character, plot\/events, and the ending. In an ideal tragedy, the character doesn't have to be an evil villain, but a many who isn't particularly evil or good, who makes a mistake which gives him misfortune. The plot of the tragedy would also have to be so that the story starts happy, then gets worse, essentially ending with a terrible ending. ","397":"An ideal tragedy according to Aristotle means it has a good  plot, the change of fortune goes from good to bad not bad to go good. He also says the good story's are founded on a few houses on the fortunes of people. ","398":"1. The plot of a tragic hero should be a man that is neither good nor evil whose life falls apart because of a mistake, or error of judgement.  He must be highly renowned or propserous- of high noble ranking. The hero of a tragedy should be relatable to the audience. ","399":"Aristotle described an ideal tragedy to have a complex plot, a well constructed plot that is single in its issue. and what happeed to the villian should not be exposed because you are supposed to focus on  the hero.","400":"Different social classes were involved in this government by stucturing poeple in something like a pyramid. The text says, \"Egyptian society was structured like a pyramid.\" This explains that a pyramid gets smaller as you get to the top and the social classes groups get smaller as you get to the people that have a lot of power. This claim is important because it is important to us as a reader to understand how the social classes invovled in this government by Egyptians.","401":"Factories would cover up spoiled meat by canning it or making sausage. They would put the meat anywhere that people wouldn't be able to find out it was spoiled.","402":"According to Aristotle, a perfect tragedy should be more complex than it is simple. Another element of an ideal tragedy would be one with a double thread of plot. The last element of an ideal tragedy would be  when a tragedy doesn't satisfy moral sense and doesn't show the downfall of the villain in the story.","403":"One element of an ideal tragedy is to have a complex plan.  A tragedy needs to \"excite pity and fear\" and should not be simple.  The character of an ideal tragedy should not be \"eminentky good and just\" he needs to be a complex character. When there is a plot twist in a tragedy, it should not go from \"bad to good\" rather it should go from \"good to bad.\"","404":"Factory workers would cover up smells and covers with chemicals like pickle to destroy the smell, as in paragraph 1, and borax and gelatin to color it and preserve it, as seen in paragraph 5. They wanted to make the most out of what they had, so they kept spoiled meat and preserved it in order to sell more. They allowed rats to run around and scat on open piles of meat and fill the room with diseases, in which they left poisoned bread for the rats to feast on. ","405":"    The Egyptian government was made up of all different kinds of jobs. Pharaohs, priests, soldiers, any job that has a higher rank on the social class pyramid.  The government was in charge of keeping records on people, making sure everyone was doing their job, and overall watching and making sure Egypt was doing okay. But the government was not just made up of 2-3 people. It can range up to lots of people! Everyone had a different job. I know this because paragraphs 4-5, it states \"No single person could manage all these duties without assistance. The pharaoh appointed a chief minister called a vizier as a supervisor. The vizier ensured that taxes were collected. Working with the vizier were scribes who kept government records. These high-level employees had mastered a rare skill in ancient Egypt \u2014 they could read and write.\" This tells me that multiple people in charge of the government had different jobs. I know multiple social classes could be involved because in paragraph 6, it states \"Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions, they profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods.\" This paragraph tells me that multiple different social classes had different jobs, and being part of the government was a paid position.","406":"According to paragraph 1, it states they would either can it or chop it into sausage. The text also mentioned that they would rub it up with soda to take the smell away.","407":"It should be a complex plan, so it should be a very complex tradegy.

Below the pharoah was the vizier, the vizier was a supervisor and ensured that all taxes were collected. Working for the viziers were scribes, scribes kept government records and also was very highly seen in ancient Egypt because they could read and write. Also below the pharoah were nobles and priests that were very powerful because only nobles could hold governemnt posts. Priests helped the pharaohs please the gods. Below the preists were soldiers who fought in wars and guided the peasants, farmers, and slaves who were also helping to build the structures of the pyramid. Then, there were physicians and craftmen who made up the middle class. Craftmen created and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, tools, and other needed things. The people that bought the goods were the artisans and traders. The merchants were the people who sold the goods to the people.

Aristotle writes that \"A perfect tragedy...not on the simple but on the complex plan.\" This shows that a good tragedy must be complex if it is to rise above others. Aristotle also writes \"...a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about...by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned...\" This proves that Aristotle believes that the main character of a great tragedy must be a man who is neither good nor evil, but somewhere in between; and that that man must be prosperous or renowned. Finally, Aristotle states \"...pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves.\" Therefore, if a tragedy were to display a man such as one described above, and have a random, unforeseen misfortune befall him, the audiences would easily be able to relate. In the world, no one knows what fate has in store, and this specific setting easily allows audience members to imagine themselves as the main character.

[...] After only three days, the experiment took on a life of its own, with students from all over the school joining in. The class expanded from initial 30 students to 43 attendees\" (CommonLit). This cluster of text qoutes shows how legitamately the student took directions because the students did not even hesitate to follow orders nor did they question the ethics of some of the rules. For example, not a single student questioned the morals of the salute when it was purposefully intended to resemble that of the Nazi regime's salute. This not only proves how naive minor's can be to their superiors but also demonstrates how quickly society can follow one another when the majority is commiting said action. This is the classic case that everyone and their neighboor's mom told you as a kid: \"If your friend jumped off a bridge would you jump too?\"- in this case and many, yes, you would be more likely to commit an action, even if it may be questionable, if your peers are also participating in the action. This fact connects back not only many examples throughout human history but in varying life forms across the globe.

For example, Romeo and Juliet create a situation in which they both end up killing themselves over the death of the other. In Greek tragedies, the characters must live with their mistakes and suffer, while in Shakespearian tragedies, the characters die. These two are similar because each person has misfortune brought upon them by their own misjudgment.

Since the Egyptians believed their rulers were gods, they entrusted them with many responsibilities. Protection being his most important responsibility. Since one person couldn't manage all of these responsibilities the pharaoh appointed a chief minister called a vizier as a supervisor. The job of vizier was to collect taxes.

They saw the other kids salute in the hallways and how well they began to do in school and decideed it was time for them to join and become like the others. Mr. Jones decided to stop it though because he had already proven his hypothesis and wanted to tell the students what he had done.

The third element to a tragedy is that it should not be simple, there should be a complex plot.

Lastly, his downfall must be brought about as the result of an error on his part rather than by a grave sin.","709":"    The Third Wave developed over a short period of time because of the salute they had to do.

There were many different ways the workers would cover up the fact that they were selling poisoned meat, one more example being that they \"preserved it with borax and color it with gelatin to make it brown\", which is not only unsafe because of the poisoned meat, but also because of the amount of color that was added to it to make it edible for customers.","714":"The first element is that the main character should not be overly good or bad because that does not possess the qualities of a tragedy.

Furthermore, the author states, \"At the top were the gods, such as Ra, Osiris, and Isis.\" This shows that since the top were gods, the higher you were, the more power you had because the Egyptians worshipped gods the most so they put the gods on top.","721":"Pharophs who were held at the top, were the godlike ceos and made the major decisons.

One of the ways being that they used pickles to cover up the stench that the rotten meat had released. And when the meat was able to be smelt over the pickles, they just added a more powerful pickle to over power the smell of the rotton meat. Another way the covered up the rotton meat, was that they got rid of the bone that was near the bad meat.

Not only are the factories willing to do this but the employees aswell.  Looking at this question of whether or not to use supplies to contaminate meat seems like a very simple answer. However, to the factory workers in the twentieth century, it was not. Not only was it not a simple answer there was no question.  \"There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms; and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it ... . It was too dark in these storage places to see well ... There was no place for the men to wash their hands before they ate their dinner\" (4-5) Sinclair goes on to explain that there was not an option for the workers, and the factory owners knew this.  They knew the workers needed the money to provide for their families.  To add to the atmosphere of the factories Sinclair says, \"With one member trimming beef in a cannery, and another working in a sausage factory, the family had a first-hand knowledge\" (1) The people were scared to step up for fear of backlash from their \"family\".   This is another example of things that factory owners used to control and cover up spoiled meat.  Using supplies such as borax, glycerin, and soda and creating a toxic work environment are two examples of methods factories used to cover up spoiled meat.","728":" there would be hams found spoiled, some of them with an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them.

Also the workers would fill the ham with pickle and they even say they couldnt stand to be in the same room with the odor. This is stated in paragraph 2.  Another way they would cover the spoiled meet is by addeding different types of meat into it and chemicals. For example is sausage was moldly it would be dosed in borax and glycerin. That is explained in paragraph 3. ","732":"As Aristole analyises what would be the most ideal tragedy, he explained that three of the most important elements of a tragedy are creating a protagonist who is not an entirly evil or outstanding but a normal human man who does not fight a physical villain but his own mistakes or faults. Another improtant element Aristole stated was the change in the protagonist's fortune from good to bad instead of the reverse, this allows for the reader to relate further with the character and his or her actions. Finally, an ideal tragedy needs to result with a  pleasure relating to a comedy rather than a \"true tragic pleasure.\"","733":"Farmering paid taxes in the form of grains and the pharoh's stored it in thier warehouses and this grain was for \" This grain was used to feed the people in the event of a famine.\"  Also the vizier ensured that taxes were collected.","734":"They used chemicals and other ingredients in order to cover up the smell, and also the way it taste.

Mr. Jones as we know had a group of highschoolers as his test subjects, and this had a very big affect on why the movement was so successful. These teens were so importnat becasue they dont have a lot that divides them, they are impressionable, and they don't have anything of their own yet, meaning that they may not be  concerned with the rights of an individual. These traits are so important because it makes it so that the teens won't question the experiment, they won't mind the lack of democracy, and they are easily united under the common goal of strength. With this rapid growth in the organisation the kids were becoming more and more brainwashed because of herd behavior, and the it needed to be ended because something bad could happen.

In paragraph 2 and 3, it said that the Pharaoh had absolute power over his subjects. The Pharaoh was consideried to be a god in human form and he was the ruler of Egypt.

In paragraph 4 and 5, it said there was a vizier who  was a superviser to the Pharaoh and made sure the taxes were collected and working with the viziers were scribes who kept govenment records. Right bellow the Pharaoh were the nobles and priests. In paragraph 6 and 7, it says, the priests were responsible for pleasing the gods. The nobles had great status and grew wealthy from the donations that people gave to the gods. Only nobles were able hold government posts. In paragraph 9 and 10, it says, skilled workers like the physicians and craftsmen\/women made up the middle class. Craftsmen made and sold useful things such as papyrus, pottery, tools, and jewelry. At the bottom of the social hierarchy were farmers and slaves. In paragraph 11, 12, and 13, it says that farmers tended the feilds and raised animals. They also kept canals and reservoirs in good order and built royal monuments. Farmers paid taxes that could cost up to 60% of their yearly harvest. Slaves were captured prisoners of war and were forced to work on building pojects.

The charactor should also be wellknown\/famous. The plot of a ideal tragedy should be foccussed on a single issue and tranistion from good to bad. The ending must always end in a tragedy without a solution. ","741":"Three of the main elements of a great tragedy are as follows: actions that incite pity and fear, a change of fortune from good to bad, and the exclusion of the utter downfall of the villian. Aritsotle explains that the feeling of pity and fear is \"the distinctive mark of tragic imitation\" (2). In order for one to incite those feelings from an audience, someone who is neither fully good, nor bad, has to befall a misfortune. This misfortune has to come from a good place and change circumstances for the worse. \"The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty...\" (Aristotle 3). This means that in order to have a good tradegy, one must have a main character make a costly mistake that causes them great hardship. The last element of a good tragedy is the avoidance of the utter downfall of a villain, because, according to Aristotle, \"...it would inspire neither pity nor fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves\" (2). And as stated earlier, pity and fear are one of the most necessary components to an ideal tragedy, so if villian dies a horrible death, the story won't have the necessary components. If that story has these three main elements - pity and fear, misfortune, and the avoidance of the downfall of a villian, it would make a great tragedy.","742":"When meat was spoiled they did many things disgusting and unsanitry things to get rid of it.

One of these qualities is to \"be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan.\" as well as \"it should imitate actions which excite pity and fear\".  These two qualities are also paired with The fact that it would \"change the place of fortune presented must not be a spectacle of a virtuous man\".  These 3 elements are what Aristotle describes his ideal tragedy to contain.","745":"An ideal tragedy has one issue, it has to go good to bad not reverse.  Meaning the \"story\" cant start off really bad and turn good at the end. The tragedy cant comes from a person that is known to be good or cant be from bad behavior etc but from a mistake.","746":"The factory would dose the meat with chemicals in order to get rid of the odor.  They also mix old, spoiled meat with fresh meat.  This is described in paragraph 3 where the article states in the department of Elzbieta, \"It was only when the whole ham was spoiled that it came into the department of Elzbieta. Cut up by the two-thousand-revolutions- a-minute flyers, and mixed with half a ton of other meat, no odor that ever was in a ham could make any difference.\"  This shows that rotten meat was mixed with other meat in order to cover up the fact that is was spoiled.","747":"Meat factory worker would prepare rotten And diseased meat with better metals. The scarps and pork fat would be packed in a can and most of the meats were chopped up with each other and was turned into a sausage","748":"An ideal tragedy should be arranged on a complex plan, the story or play should have a well constructed plot, the change of fortune should be good to bad instead of bad to good. It should imitate actions that excite pity and fear, the play or story should make you feel excited and it should make you more interested based on the emotions and actions of the charaters. Lastly, the change of fortune must not be the spectale of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity.","749":"     The workers of these American spoiled meat factories would keep the spoiled meat and mix it with fresh meat to give out for home conssumption. This was a common custom done. They also used a chemicals like borax and glycerin to get rid of the smell and spoiledness.  The author states, \"also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose.\" In factories, chemicals were the wonders to economic prosperity from spoiled meat. They also used names to give a sense of good food instead of spoiled food to the public.","750":"\"there would come all the way back from Europe old sausage that had been rejected, and that was moldy and white \u2013 it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption.\" (paragraph 3)","751":"The elements of an ideal tragedy include a plot that satisfied the moral sense, a character who suffers from misfortune, and  a change of fortune.  The plot should be ideally written to create a sense of various emotions in the reader, hwoeve it must not necesarily cause fear. The character must be someone who deals with misfortune for practically the whole story, but at the end will most likely not have a \"happy ending\".  The change of fortune has to be from good to bad to emphasize the misfortune the character will suffer, if the change is from bad to good then the story would not be a tragedy.

The experiment was ended so quickly because with the amount of people that were a part of the movement created for an experiment, it was getting to a point where it would eventually be uncontrollable. Also, with more people becoming a part of it, the movement would qucikley become known to the rest of the  world and eventually be spread to the rest of the population. As seen during the reign of Hitler, when a whole population is under one persons control, there can be violent and dangerous outcomes in persue of a country's honor.","754":"One element must be the downfall of a hero or the character through some error of judgement . Second, is the fact that it must bring forth the emotion of pity and fear since it is the mark of tragic imitaion. The final element is the fact that the  change of fortune must go from good to bad and not the other way around. ","755":" Egyptians believed that the gods controlled the universe. Therefore, it was important to keep them happy. During long periods of peace, soldiers also supervised the peasants, farmers, and slaves who were involved in building such structures as pyramids and palaces.","756":"They were many different social classes. The pharaohs , the egiptian society, the nobles, the priests,soldiers, farmers, social mobility. The Eyiptian society had many structures that looks like pyiramids.

The very top of the pyramid consisted of the gods and below them were the pharaohs who were believed to be gods in human forms and had absolute power over the lower status'. Viziers assissted in the pharaohs work and managed duties alongside them. Next in status of pharoahs were the nobles and preists, they had the ability to hold government posts. Below them were slaves and farmers who were at the bottom of the social structure. With each class, they were all invovled in building the government system by having a social structure that has everyone connected. ","759":"The three elements of an ideal tragedy would be; having a complex plan that excite pity and fear onto those experiencing it,  change of fortune from good to bad,  it ending in dramatic tragic effects. The complex plan should excite pity and fear if done right, because if planned out right it falls onto the most vulnerable people. The change of fortune from good to bad is to have someone doing good fall from a high point to an extremly low point, causing the tragedy. Dramatic tragic effects in the end cause the most conflict as to showing everyone how the tradgey completly changed them.","760":"The expieriment develpoed rapidly and the students were very loyal to the rules and disicipline that Jones gave them.  The students even began following the rules outside of the classroom. By the  fourth day, Jones had seen that the expieriment was getting out of control and had to stop it.","761":"Children and young adults are easily convinced to follow movements without knowing what the effects will be. Once the students started stopping non-members from entering classes, they joined it.","762":"One of the elements Aristotle claims is crucial to constructing an ideal tragedy is the emphasis on building a story out of pity and misfortune. As stated in paragraph 2, Aristotle remarks that \" It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation.\" Aristotle is explaining how the best method of displaying tragedy in any poem is to put the main characters in a constant state of misfortune, which is meant to drive forward the narritive as it progresses. Next, Artistotle exclaims that the main character in a tragedy should never been considered \"good or bad\", but in between the two extremes. He claims in paragraph 2, \"that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity,  but by some error of judgement or frailty\". He emphasizes that the best way to craft a main character in a tragedy is not to witness a good man suffer from misfortune or a bad man pay for his crimes, but a simple man suffer for making mistakes that may be relatable to the reader themselves. Finally, Aristotle suggests that good tragedies must always involve particular families who have evil pasts. He explains this in paragraph 3 when he states, \" Now, the best tragedies are founded on the story of a few houses \u2014 on the fortunes of Alcmaeon, Oedipus, Orestes, Meleager, Thyestes, Telephus, and those others who have done or suffered something terrible.\" This describes how building narratives based around icons of tragedies enhances the feelings of pity and misfortune when the main characters experince the tragedies themselves.","763":"In order to cover up the spoiled meat, the factory would \"rub it up with soda to take away the smell\", and \"the packers had a second and much stronger pkickle which destroyed the odor\".","764":"Pharaohs were known as powerful nobles and priest to this goverement ,\"Nobles were the only one who could hold goverment posts.\"  \"priests were responsible for pleasing the gods.\" Soldiers fought in these goverment wars or quelled domestic uprising. Soldiers supervised the peasants,farmers and slaves.  Craftsmen made and sold jewelery,pottery and papyrus products to make extra money. And lastly slaves were used to be \"prisoners\" in war. They were also forced to work on building projects. ","765":"There was many ways factories covered up the spoiled meat. They would use gelatin to color the sausage to make it appear brown. They would rub the meat up with soda to get rid of the odor.

It can be double and could even change to the complete opposite.","768":"    The factory employed many tactics to cover up the spoiled meat. One tactic that they used was to sell spoiled meat treated with soda\/chemicals. They would \"rub it up with soda to take away the smell\", allowing them to sell the meat without raising questions. They would also use a strategy of pickling the meat to hide the smell. Finally, they would replace spoiled bones of the meat with an iron, creating \"boneless hams.\"","769":"        The acient Egyption system is differnt from america cause they have to belive in pharos and gods but not just any regular gods bad and evil gods and they are considered slave also they have to build statues.","770":"they ended the experiment because it got out of hand at the ended because jone had the kid munipulated.to the point that they were brainwashed to listen to jones.","771":"Three elements of an ideal tragedy include having one main issue, the story should change from good to bad not from bad to good (it should not have a happy ending), the bad event should occur because of a character's flaws (like mistakes they have made) not because of an outside source or because the character is evil per se.","772":"The ancient government started with a pharaoh who is basically a god.

Meat that smelled bad would be \"rubbed up with soda to take away the smell\" and sold \"to be eaten on free-lunch counters\"","775":"The third wave developed over a short period of time because people felt like they had to join and it ended because it got out of controll. In the text it says, \"and by the end of the day the movement had over 200 participants.\" Also it says, \" Jones felt it was slipping out of control\" This is showing that so many people joned so quick it got out of controll and it became big becasue so many people convinced them to join.","776":"Aristotle described that perfect tragedy should be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan. Aristotle states that the change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. Aristotle said normally the downfall is supposed to be caused by a one simple \"error of judgement.\" ","777":"a man who is doing well for him slef and is growing rich because of a good bussnies and one day he makes a dirty deal with a mob boss and he agress to smuggle drugs in his semi truck for extra money and then he is caught and he losses his licence, his company, and his money because he is fined hevaly after he has no job he cant get a normal job because he is a drug smuggeler for a bad bad gang so no he is homless and cant get money ","778":"The factory would use or cover up the spoiled meat in different ways to make it useful and sell its product. One way they spoiled the meat is by canning it or chopping it into sausage as is mentioned in the first paragraph they do this process to use everything from the animal, but they have help from some men that work in the pickle rooms. They would \"rub it up with soda to take away the smell\" to make it at least not smell bad and be able to sell it. They cover all the spoiled meat with chemicals to give it another odor and another color.

There were also soliders, which mostly fought battles, but also supervised slaves and peasants. The middle class consisted of jewelerly makers, craftsmen, and potters.

","783":"Slaves and farmers, who were basically the workers of the Egyptian society were at the bottom, as they helped build projects for the pharaoh or nobles, and the farmers did basic farm work, tending to animals, keeping land in good order, etc. The farmers had a lot of troubles as they also had to pay a lot more taxes than the average person. \"Farmers paid taxes that could amount to as much as 60% of their yearly harvest\u2014that\u2019s a lot hay!\"  #15 Soldiers and skilled workers were the next level above in which soldiers would fight in wars, settle uprisings, and when they didn't have anything else to do, they monitored those working like peasants, farmers, and slaves. The skilled people were basically gifted craftsmen and women who made goods and items like jewerly, pottery, tools, and papyrus, some of them also became merchants who sold the goods to the public. Above them were viziers, scribes, nobles, and priests. Viziers were chief ministers appointed by pharaohs to ensure that taxes were collected. Scribes worked with the vizers and kept government records. They had a rare skill in Egypt, they could read and write. Nobles were the only class able to hold government posts in which they would gain tributes and profit off what was given to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods. At the top were the pharaohs and Gods, the ancient Egyptians believed the gods were in control of the universe and everything that happened inside of it, it was important to keep the gods happy or they could cause the Nile River to flood, the gods could cause famine, or cause people to die. The Egyptians also believed some humans were gods in human form called pharaohs, they were in control of basically everyone , they had many responsible, as keeping taxes in check, directing armies incase of foreign threats, and making laws.

Their pharaohs were believed to be gods in human form. They had absolute power over their subjects. The pharaoh also appointed a chief minister called a vizier as a supervisor.

Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods. Nobles enjoyed great status and also grew wealthy from donations to the gods. Then we have the midle class, made up of physicians and craftsmen. Craftsmen made and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, tools, and other useful things.","789":"The Third Wave developed over such a short period of time because the students really enjoyed it. The experiment was ended because the teacher started losing control of his students.","790":"The Third Wave experiment began as Ron Jones initially announced he was \"starting a movement aimed to eliminate democracy.\"(The Third Wave 1) By naming the movement \"The Third Wave\" and creating a motto that emphasizes a focus on strength through the campaign, Jones was able to create an influential area in his classroom where students would willingly join in. From there, Jones began to enforce and emphasize the importance of discipline and conformity to the authoritarian figure, Jones, created in the classroom. Students learned and complied quickly, and Jones took a step further, requiring students use the salute he created to each other even outside of class where Jones was not present. Consequently, the discline caused improvement in students's academic skills and soon enough, the number of students in the class grew rapidly. \"the students became increasingly involved in the project and their discipline and loyalty to the project was so outstanding that Jones felt it was slipping out of control.\"(The Third Wave 4) Observing the speed at which other students were willing to conform and join the movement, Jones believed the experiment was becoming out of hand; he decided to end the experiment, ultimately revealing that the \"movement\" demonstrated how people can be lead to justify bad things in the guise of honor from the sense of superiority they create over others.","791":"How the Third Wave developed over such a short period of time is that it was an experiment to explain  to his students of how people throughout history followed the crowds even when terrible things are happening, and so he decided to demonstrate it to the students through an experiment.

A complex plan of a plot is extremly important in order to have an ideal tradgedy.  The plot must move from the begining to the end according to a cramped sequence of events that are to happen.  Furthermore, another element to an ideal plot is charecter.  \"Now, the best tragedies are founded on the story of a few houses \u2014 on the fortunes of Alcmaeon, Oedipus, Orestes, Meleager, Thyestes, Telephus, and those others who have done or suffered something terrible\".  A plot should consist of a charceter going from joy to misery as the plot progresses.  A final element in order to form a perfect tradegdy is thought.  A charecter should have a tragic deed or mistake, ususally towards the end, in which his thoughts are shown out loud and leads to the most tragic of poems.","822":"To cover up spoiled pig they would eairther put it in a can or chop it into sausages.

In paragrah 10, it states that \"At the bottom of the social structure were slaves and farmers. Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war. In addition to being forced to work on building projects, slaves toiled at the discretion of the pharaoh or nobles.\" This shows that the farmers and slaves did not want to do the work but were captured by the higher-ups to do work for them.

The author explains the mix of meat ano poor quality by saying, \"The packers were always originating such schemes- they had what they called \"boneless hams\", which were all the odds and ends of pork stuffed into casings\" (2). Primarily, workers in faculties would utilize chemicals, such as borax and gelatin. These would color the meat and preserve it. \"it would be does with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers,and made over again for home consumption\" (3).  This shows the workers true lack of care for the meat quality, with minimal effort to even cover the smell.","855":"The Third Wave developed over such a short period of time because people would follow the crowd and they stopped non-members from entering the class, and using other tasks to bring honor to the movement.

The factory only cares about making money so they would use any and all meat possible.

This shows that when a certain meat was labeled as spoiled they would send it to get put into a can for canned meat or it would be processed into a sausage. It also states in the text, \"There was never the least attention paid to what was cut up for sausage; there would come all the way back from Europe old sausage that had been rejected, and that was moldy and white \u2013 it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption\".

He believes the character who commits the tragic flaw should be a fair character who is well known, and should be not a great nor terrible person. For example, in Romeo and Juliet, Romeo isn't a villian or an amazing person, but rather a typical teenage boy more than anything else.  In addition, Aristotle believes the tragic flaw should not occur due to immoral behavior by the character, but rather by an error or a mistake. For example, Romeo's tragic flaw came through his impulsive decision to marry Juliet, which wasn't a terrible, immoral act. Lastly, the plot of a tragedy should consist of a good to bad change of fortune. In the beginning of the tragedy, the character should experience something good, but his\/her's fortune should turn to something bad towards the end. Overall, the ideas of a neither good nor bad character, an underserving misfortune, and a flow of a good to bad fortune are three of Aristotle's many elements of an ideal tragedy.

The author also said that slaves were forced to work on building projects. (paragraph 11). Even though slaves and farmers were at the very bottom of the pyramid, it wasn't impossible to move up.

Just like said on paragraph 1, \"Egyptian society was structured like a pyramid. At the top were the gods, such as Ra, Osiris, and Isis,\" which can support what this social structure existed for. Examples I would provide for this is the entire  \"The Chain of Command\" section, paragraph 6, \"Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions they profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods,\" and paragraphs 8-13.

For example, if meat is discovered to be sour after being taken from the pickle, it is rubbed with soda to take the smell away.

This meant that to successfully cover up the unsanitary meat sold to the public, chemistry was practiced to make it look healthy. In addition, chemical combinations, such as borax and glycerin, were added to spoiled meat and dumped back into the hopper to be sold to the public (paragraph 3). They were able to not only preserve the moldy meat with borax, but also mixed it in with fresh meats to cover up the taste or smell of spoiled meat.

Aristotle believes that a good tragedy doesn't just show for the spectacle, but truly makes us feel for the characters, and incites those feelings of pity and fear.  As Aristotle states, \"It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity: for this moves neither pity nor fear.\" Aristotle also believes that another element of the ideal tragedy does not feature a turn from bad to good, but instead should feature the reverse and should go from good to bad. He believes that this turn should be brought about by a crucial mistake made by a character. The third element of an ideal tragedy is one with a single issue as its plot. Aristotle compares those with a \"double threat of plot\", like the Odyssey, as second rank. He believes that it is only considered the best because of the weakness of the audience. A true poet doesn't write just based on the wishes of the audience and because of that misses the true tragic pleasure of an ideal tragedy.","984":"They would cover thme up with scents and they would mix it up with other things which is stated in paragraph 2\"spoiled, some of them with an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them.

This means to make the reader feel a specific way while reading the play. The final element of a tragidy should be the structure of good to bad rather then bad to good. This represents the fourtune of the story and that they should end in a catastrophe. Overall these elements are needed to make a ideal tragedy.","986":"The top was really important and included Gods and pharaohs.

Firstly,  Aristotle believed that a plot should be complicated rather than simple. The text states \"A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan\" (Aristotle). This quote shows how he believes a complicated plot is a necessity for tragedy. Aristotle  also believed that a tragedy should cause pity and fear in the audience. in paragraph 2, the text states, \" It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation\" (Aristotle). This once again brings up the topic of catharsis otherwise known as emotional release. Aristotle believes that a true tragedy should make the audience feel pity and frightened and be able to release these emotions because of the show. Aristotle also believed that the characters should be relatable to invoke this fear into the people. The text states, \"that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity\" (Aristotle). This explains how a charcter that is morally grey, as most humans are, will be more relatable and make the audience feel pity. They will also be scared, because they do not want this to happen to themselves. Lastly,  Aristotle believes that these plays should end tragically or else it is second tiered.  The article states \" The pleasure, however, thence derived is not the true tragic pleasure. It is proper rather to Comedy, where those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies \u2014 like Orestes and Aegisthus \u2014 quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain\" (Aristotle). In this he is explaining that without the unhappy ending, it doesnt not give the audience 'true tragic pleasure'. This is what Aristotle charcterized Greek tragedies by during his time as a philosopher.","1057":"In the text \"Egyptian Social Structure\" By USHistory.ong, in paragraph 1  it starts off telling us that Egyptian society is like a pyramid, the pharaoh at the top.

(paragraph 8) The soldiers fought in war and other fights, right after them are the peasants, farmers, and slaves. The farmers and slaves (etc) are at the bottem making the nobles, priests, and the soldiers go to the middle. The social classes that were most involved in the government, but in different classes are the nobles and the soldiers because the soldiers were involved in war and supervise the peasants and etc...(paragraph 8).

First, he believes that an ideal tragedy should have events that evoke pity or fear for the protagonist. He states this in paragraph two: \"It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation.\" He goes on to explain how the audience will feel pity or fear- by portraying a protagonist who is not particularly good or evil, just an ordinary person who falls into misfortune. Second, Aristotle claims that a good tragedy should have a suitable plot that is not too complicated and in which the fortune turns from good to bad because of the characters' actions. He establishes this in the third paragraph: \"A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain. The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse. \" Finally, Aristotle highlights that the play should not be written based on what the audience wants- \"It is accounted the best because of the weakness of the spectators; for the poet is guided in what he writes by the wishes of his audience. The pleasure, however, thence derived is not the true tragic pleasure\". Those are three of the elements that Aristotle says should be in an ideal tragedy.","1085":"3 elements of the ideal tragedy are that it should be arranged on the complex plan not simple, it should also excite pity and fear. as he goes on to explain how these things will work he also says, \"Nor, again, that of a bad man passing from adversity to prosperity: for nothing can be more alien to the spirit of Tragedy; it possesses no single tragic quality\u00a8 (Aristotle).

The article states that \"by the end of the day the movement had over 200 participants,\" (CommonLit Staff 3) when the class originated with only 30 students. Only 4 days into the experiment, Jones noticed that the students had become \"increasingly invovled in the project\" (CommonLit Staff 4), which prompted him to end the experiment. The students had showcased that they were willing to do potentially damaging things in the name of their cause.

Pickle juice is made of vinegar and salt which help preserve the meat.

If there was a happy ending added, the writer would not be truly writing for the topic of tragedy, but to write for the audience's desired ending instead. This form of tragedy would be considered a comedy.  Additionally, the main character of the plot should experience tragedy through his own shortcomings and not by inevitable adversity. It is up to the main character's choices to set up obstacles for themselves. The plot throughout the story should set a pitiful and fearful scene as well. This fear and pity should come from the character's faults.

Each aspect that was added further developed the experiment. More and more students got involved because they wanted to be apart of something and follow what they saw their friends doing. This made the experiment larger than Mr. James had planned. The experiment was ended because the students displine and loyalty to the project was so large that Mr. James thought it was getting out of control.

Next we have the soldiers. Soldiers fought in wars or quelled domestic uprisings.  When there was peace, soldiers supervised peasants, farmers,  and slaves who built structures. Physicians and craftsmen were the middle class. They made jewelry, pottery, papyrus, tools, and other products. There were merchants and storekeepers who sold these products. Finally, the last social class were slaves and farmers. The slaves built pyramids or other structures. Farmers tended fields, raised animals, kept canals, reservoirs, worked in the stone quarries, and built royal monuments. Farmers paid taxes with grain.  Everyone on the social class pyramid had jobs. They were all busy people. Even the top of the pyramid had important jobs.","1341":"they were different in social classes involved in this government because the fate of those captured as prisoners of was.

The experiemnt was ended because the students had spread it around the school, and were so involved and serious that it got out of hand.","1346":"     One ideal element in a tragedy has to be the arrangement.

Different social classes were involved and went down the stack like this: Pharaohs, nobles\/priests, and farmers\/slaves. According to the text, \"Their leaders, called pharaohs, were believed to be gods in human form.\" This perfectly explains why pharaohs were at the top of the pyramid because the text also says the following: \"Egyptians believed that the gods controlled the universe. Therefore, it was important to keep them happy.\" What better way to make somebody happy than making them rich and powerful? The next rung on the ladder was the one held by nobles and priests, however, these were not much lower than the pharaohs. Quote: \"Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions, they profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods.\"  This clearly shows that while below pharaohs, nobles and priests were still majorly important in Egyptian culture. Next were physicians and craftsmen. Quoted here, \"Skilled workers such as physicians and craftsmen\/women made up the middle class. Craftsmen made and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, tools, and other useful things.\" The middle class was still needed and wanted, unlike the bottom of the pyramid, which was farmers and slaves. As I quote here, \"At the bottom of the social structure were slaves and farmers. Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war. In addition to being forced to work on building projects, slaves toiled at the discretion of the pharaoh or nobles.\" Also, \"Farmers tended the fields, raised animals, kept canals and reservoirs in good order, worked in the stone quarries, and built the royal monuments. Farmers paid taxes that could amount to as much as 60% of their yearly harvest\u2014that\u2019s a lot of hay!\" These guys were given less happy lives by default.","1362":"making spoiled meat into sausage \"whenever meat was so spoiled that it could not be used for anything else, either to can it or else to chop it up into sausage.\"","1363":"In an ideal tragedy, the plot should \"be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan\"(Aristotle 2), the sequence of the plot should evoke pity and fear. Another crucial aspect is that the character must not be completely and morally good while not being brought down by his vices or moral corruption , but \" by some error of judgement or frailty\"(2). A third element of an ideal tragedy is \"[the] change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad\"(2).","1364":"An element of an ideal tragedy is that it should be arranged as a complex plan and should not be plain and simple. The reason for this is because it enables for the tragedy to become complex and not a straightfoward plan which allows for the writer to maintain and incite specific emotions throughout the complex structure.","1365":"The Third Wave movement deveopled so quickly because the students felt superior because of it. When the teacher intorduced the movement to them, they took it and ran.

This was so sucessful, because it resluted in things to improve and to be more organized.

He felt as if that his experiment was getting to be to much.","1367":"     Humans naturally follow the crowd and the common behavior of those around them, so Mr. Jones wanted to display this to his students.  The Third Wave was conducted in a strict and authoritative manor.  It was presented in a way to symbolize strength  and highlight democracy's weakness.  Catchy and appealing chants were used to hold students' attention and spread the word.  Even outside of the classroom, students willingly followed orders to salute other students and talk about the group.  Strictness and repetition brought a like way of thinking.  Students gained a sense of superiority and righteousness which formed the experiment into a cult-like group.  Jones felt the experiment was slipping out of control, so it had to be stopped.  The word had reach abundant and dangerous levels.  The movement kicked off with the attraction to catchy words and lived on through the human need to assimilate.","1368":"For it was the custom, as they found, whenever meat was so spoiled that it could not be used for anything else, either to can it or else to chop it up into sausage. It was only when the whole ham was spoiled that it came into the department of Elzbieta. Cut up by the two-thousand-revolutions-a-minute flyers, and mixed with half a ton of other meat, no odor that ever was in a ham could make any difference. There was never the least attention paid to what was cut up for sausage; there would come all the way back from Europe old sausage that had been rejected, and that was moldy and white\u2014it would be dosed with borax and glycerine, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption. There would be meat that had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and sawdust, where the workers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption germs. There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms; and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of rats would race about on it. It was too dark in these storage places to see well, but a man could run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of the dried dung of rats. These rats were nuisances, and the packers would put poisoned bread out for them; they would die, and then rats, bread, and meat would go into the hoppers together.","1369":"The variouse way that the fcatory can make so that their meat doesnt spoil all the time would  be to be in much safer and sanitary conditions. \"There would be meat that had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and sawdust, where the workers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption germs.\" This is a quote that tells us only a little bit because just by reading this, it makes me feel sick now emagine how many days had the meat been there juts hanging. or even about how long the bacteria has been on the meat of the pig thats why it is always being spolied.","1370":"The structure was sort of like how it is now but a lot more strict.

We just classify the rich people as upperclass,for example when you are on a plane rich people or just people who have enough extra money pay for first class. ","1371":"3 elements that were described by Aristole are character, plot, and thought. He described these to help add into the chain of how tradgedy could start.

Another reason why the group grew so big, so quickly because as more people joined others who were not apart of the group felt left out and some were probably peerpressured into joining, this fear of missing out could be the reason that many of the member joined. (The Expiriment)\", stopping non-members from entering the class\"  you can see that non-members were treated differently than others, being at an equal could be another reason why so many people joined.","1375":"Mr.Jones wanted to show his students how people follow a crowd  even when there doing horriable things.Mr.Jones intended it to only be a one day expirement how ever it took a life of its own, even having over 200 particepents.The expirement ended at the end of the week letting the students know that they were a part of an expirement.","1376":"An element of a tragedy should be a complex plan.

There must also be the characters that will exhibit \"a man who is not eminently good\" however he will endure \"misfortune\" to create a deeper plot to the ideal tragedy.","1383":"The different social classes were involved in the government. First the pharoah which is a godlike figure was at the top of the social structure were ruling the land.

Only nobles could be in the government and priest were responsible for pleasing the god. In the article the author says, \"Only nobles could hold goverment posts... Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods.\" (Paragraph 6) In the middle class there wads skilled workers. They produced things for trade and for people to buy. In the article the author states, \"Craftsmen made and sold jewerly...there were people needed to buy goods...These were merchants.\" (Paragraph 9 and 10) Lastly at the bottom of the social structure were farmers and slaves. The farmers harvested food and pay taxes and the slaves were forced to work on building projects and work one the discretion of the pharoahs or nobles.

Jones emphasized many simple rules and made sure the students did it right. Students also had to salute each other in a specific way that the teacher had made.

Another quote given in the text states, \"it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption.\" This is showing how they are using all of these different substances to cover up old meat instead of getting fresh meat.

First, the element of the plot for an ideal strategy is meant to be the soul of the overall tragedy as a whole, and its main responsibility to keep every other factor that is part of a tragedy together. Aristotle believes that the plot should always be provided a beginning, middle, and end, in a proper way.  \"A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain.\"(Paragraph. 3) Overall, Aristotle's belief of the concept regarding plot is to be an imitation of an action, a single action. Second, the element of the character for an ideal tragedy is meant to be considered as neither good nor bad, as a result, should instead be considered as a surprise to the audience of the character's morals. \"There remains, then, the character between these two extremes.\"(Paragraph 2) Aristotle thinks that if the tragic hero were to be better than one to be good or bad, then the tragedy as a whole would be seen as stronger than before. Third, the element of the thought for an ideal tragedy is meant to be considered always on the type of situation being given, whether it is an individual who lives in prosperity or an individual who lives in adversity. \"yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty.\"(Paragraph 2) In terms of thought, the thoughts that should be considered is if the kind of unexpected sort of events happens should they belong to the wealthy or the poor, because of someone's poor sense of judgement or by fate.

Another element Artistole believes is in an ideal tragedy is, \"the downfall of the utter villian be exhibited\" (Artistole, 2). Connecting this to Hamlet, this means that if Claudius is the villian, he shouldn't die because it would cause the audience to think of it as misfourtune. Finally, the third ideal trait that a true tragedy should posess is, \"some great error or frailty, in a chracter\" (Artistole, 3). This ultimatly means that the main character, the protagonist, shall do something utterly stupid that worsens his own life.

Eventually it got so big he had to tell the students it was a hoax, and expirement on them about conformity.","1482":"3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle was about Tragedy and how it plays in a story. What we already know about a Tragedy is that a man who is neither good nor bad is virtuous and can have pity nor fear for a protagonist or antagonist in a play.  Next, tragedies could either have some comedy or become serious for how a person's backstory or death. It also has complicated plots of why the person is doing this type of crime.  Finally, most tragedies can have it where the protagonist and antagonist are friends and no one gets slain or if the protagonist gains all the respect and honor for playing as the hero and the antagonist gets he or she's punishment or betrays the protagonist as the villain and plans on killing or getting revenge on the hero.","1483":"One way is they chop it up in sausages which is stated in paragraph 1.  In paragraph 2 they rub soda on it to take away the smell. ","1484":"An ideal tragedy should include multiple complex plots. There should be a main character who is neither good nor bad, who's life will eventually fall apart due to their choices.","1485":"the gods and pharaohs had the most power, meaning they were on the top of the social government. the pharaohs were supposed to have all the power. \"pharaohs, were believed to be gods in human form. They had absolute power over their subjects.\" (Par 6) The system goes all the way down to the slaves who had no power in anything. the slaves were captured  from their enemies. \" Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war. In addition to being forced to work on building projects, slaves toiled at the discretion of the pharaoh or nobles.\"(Par 11)","1486":"A tragedy shou,d be based on a complex plan and not a simple one. There should be raw emotions in the play to enhance the tragedy. There should be a villain or a hero in the play too, also the construction of the plot or how its arranged makes an ideal play.

All laws were enacted at the discrection of the pharoh.I belived Nobles enjoyed great status and also grew wealthy from donations to the gods. After pharaohs died,     huge stone pyramids were built as their tombs.","1490":"1. Plot- The plot of a tragedy is basically about a neutral character, who makes one bad mistake. This leads to the epic downfall of the character and the setting. ","1491":"Aristotle would say that the ideal tragedy would be a complex plan, and not arranged simple. It should have imitated action that excites pity and fear. Another element would be that it should not be bad to good, it should be from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty.","1492":"It developed pretty quickly because the student's were so many students were so divulgued in this experiment many people started to join and it got to the point were the students were taking it too serisouly so Mr. Jones decided to shut it down.","1493":"The ancient Egyptian system of government was structured into 7 different classes the pharaoh, high government officials, priests and nobles, soldiers and skilled workers, and farmers and slaves\/ the Jewish people of God. The pharaohs protected the people and directed the army. The high government officials assisted the pharaoh such as reading, writing, and collecting taxes. Priests and Nobles held government posts and pleased the gods. The soldiers and skilled workers fought wars and made goods. Finally, the slaves\/THE JEWS GOD'S PEOPLE and farmers built statues and pyramids and the farmers tended to the fields. I found this in paragraphs 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11, and12.","1494":"There were gods and pharons at the top, they were the leaders\/comanders of their land. Then nobles and preist aswell as army members were second to the top, they helped the government and put lower class people into place.

Last farmers and slaves were at the bottom, and they built things for the pharohns\/ tended to things like crops, animals, and cannals. ","1495":"Aristotle states that the most important element of an ideal tragedy is that it should excite pity and fear in the audience. He states, \"It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation\"(7-9).  This element really helps to draw in the audience and make them feel the right emotions for the characters. Another element that Aristotle believes to be valid for a tragedy is that the main character should be a normal person, not terribly good nor evil. He describes this as, \"That of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity\"(22-23). Having a more normal character makes it easier for the audience to relate to them as well as to feel for them and understand what they are going through. The last element that Aristotle describes is that of a well-constructed plot. He writes, \"The change of fortune should not be from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad\"(27).  Structuring the plot in this way truly enforces the feeling and effects of a tragedy. These are just three small elements that the great philosopher, Aristotle, believed to be important in a perfect tragedy.","1496":"It developed quickly because the students thought that being a part of a community strengthened the school.  Mr. Jones ended the experiment because it was getting out of control.","1497":"They would rub soda and chemicals on the meat to cover the smell as well as the number one grade which removed the bone of the meat to make the meat \"better\", \"Jonas had told them how the meat that was taken out of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters\" (Sinclair 2). \"it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption.\" (Sinclair 3). \" but later on some ingenious person had hit upon a new device, and now they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron.

There must be some type of flaw that happens to the main character that causes his downfall or the downfall of the ones dear to him. It cannot be brought by misfortune or depravity it must be an error of judgment. He also thinks that the fortune of the people should not start off as bad and then end up good but start as good and end to bad.

","1505":"According to Aristotle, an ideal tradgedy should imclude no downfall of the villain character. Aristotle says this beacause he states that killing the villain, \"would inspire neither pity nor fear,' becasue pity comes from undesreved misfortune. Another point an ideal tradgedy should include is a character who is not famous for being good, and one whose misfortune is brought to him by a mistake or error. So, the movie\"Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice\" would not be considered an ideal tragedy. (Ran out of time for the third point).","1506":"        Egyptian society was structured like a pyramid.

One way is that they would simply just chop it up and use it for sausage, \u00a8whenever meat was so spoiled that it could not be used for anything else, either to can it or else to chop it up into sausage\u00a8 (Sinclair 1). If the meat was so gross and spoiled that it could not be used for anything else they would just use it, along with any other meat they could not use, for sausage. For meat that was spoiled that only had a smell, they would use chemicals or soda to cover the smell, \u00a8they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell\u00a8 (Sinclair 2). Another way to cover the small was to sell it as pickled meat, \u00a8the packers had a second and much stronger pickle which destroyed the odor\u00a8 (Sinclair 2). A lot of the meatpacking industries would send their meat to other countries like Europe to be sold there, some places in Europe would have to send it back because the meat was too old and spoiled. When this happened all the packing industries would load it with chemicals to be sent back, \u00a8it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption\u00a8 (Sinclair 3).

Additionally, other conditions were that, \"...there would be hams found spoiled, some of them with an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them\"(Sinclair 2). To cover this issue up, they would rub sode on the meat to try to deordorize it. Yet, that not working shows how gross the meat really was.

The text says \"that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement .\" In this case, readers can empathize with the man in the story, in addition to fufilling the moral sense.  Lastly, the change of fourtune for the main character should be good to bad.

Primarily, Aristotle discusses about the importance of constructing a plot that goes from good to bad. Having a good to bad plot will lead to an \"end unhappily. It is... the right ending.\" If this plot is able to work, the most tragic effect will be the outcome because it satifies \"the moral sense, [and' inspires pity or fear.\" Moreover, an ideal tragedy needs to build emotions from readers. The perfect tragedy must \"imitate actions which excite pity and fear\" which is achieved by a change of fortune from good to bad. Aristotle makes it clear that emotions are able to occur when \"some great error or frailty\" happens that changes the character from descriptions mentioned before which makes a character go from good to bad. Lastly, a tragedy should be built on a complex plan. For a complex plan, the audience should feel pity for a character which would later be used against the audience. Trying to reverse the effects of making the audience feel pity to fear is key for a perfect tragedy as \"it is accounted the best because of the weakness of the spectators.\" Poets need to take audiences by surprise because it's similar to killing off the main character of a movie, for it would bring in tons of emotion and catch the audience off guard of something they would never expect to happen. All in all, Aristotle tries to convey his point of how to create a perfect tragedy and demonstrates how thoughtful and impactful a tragedy could be. However, Aristotle wants to make it more known that a short story can be constructed in an emotionally compelling way part of which still applies even in modern times.","1600":"According to the article the 3 elements of tradegy are events brought on by a mistake, the plot should start from good to bad. and must be complex not simple.","1601":"The Third Wave developed over such a short period of time  because their academic skills were getting better in the classroom and children noticed, also they had a chant which would most likely also make students more interested in joining.

For instance, when meat that was taken out of pickle was \"found sour,\" instead of scrapping the meat, the company decided to \"...rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free lunch counters\" (Sinclair). In addition, when hams that were pickled were found spoiled, some of them with, \"...an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them,\" (Sinclair), a second pickle would instead be pumped into the same meat, which destroyed the odor. This process, so often used in the meatpacking industry, became known to the workers as \"giving them thirty per cent\" (Sinclair). Lastly,  the industry would relabel products after working on the meat to make the odor, bacteria, or old parts of the meat go away, creating products such as \"boneless hams\", which were \"odds and ends of pork stuffed into casings,\" or even \"skinned hams,\" labeled as fancy, which were made of the oldest pigs, with heavy and coarse skin, \"...that no one would buy-that is, until they had been cooked and chopped fine and labeled \"head cheese!\"\" (Sinclair).

The thought that it should excite pity and fear is Aristotle saying that it should catch the attention of people and make them interested and intruiged in it, not having people bored and not focusing.

The soldiers made sure everything was in shape so the government would run smoothly.

Thus, to make it an unfogetteble play or poem, it should end in a tragic way to leave the audience stunned. For example, the text says in paragraph 3, \" The best proof is that on the stage and in dramatic competetion, such plays, if well worked out, are the most tragic in effect...\" This explains that poets have to think deeply and precisely to instill a shocked feeliing in their audience each time.","1638":"In the article \"Egyptian Social Structure\" by USHistory.org we learn how their society was structured like a pyramid.

The bone needed to be removed from the spoiled meat since that is mainly where the spoiledness would be located. Another way the spoiled meat would be preserved is in a casing. \"...all the odds and ends of pork stuffed into casings\" (Paragraph 2). Every piece of the spoiled ham would be put into a casing in which the factory would market it as a \"boneless ham\" (paragraph 2).  One more way the spoiled meat was concealed is by altering its scent and appearance. \"... and preserve it with borax and color it with gelatin to make it brown\" (paragraph 5).

The plot should be single in its issue and shouldn't go from bad to good, but from good to bad. Lastly, a tragedy should follow someone who is highly renowned and prosperous to help excite fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves.","1720":"The Third Wave was successful in expansion because the students would follow Mr. Jones and the rest of the group. This group bacame so popular that \"Jones felt it was slipping out of control.\"","1721":"An ideal tragedy described by Aristotle features the downfall of a man the people can relate to. It should emulate actions that excite pity and fear, contain a good to bad change of fortune and include a dramatic unhappy ending. The misfortune of one is to be brought by error or frailty. A good tragedy has a devastating tragic ending rather than a shocking ending. ","1722":"The plot should try to be simple, rather than branching off in a complex tree of ideas.

It was one sided because everyone that isn't at the top of the chain has to do so much to make the gods happy. The story said, \"Therefore, it was important to keep them happy. They could make the Nile overflow, cause famine, or even bring death. Differant social classes were involved by just devoting their life to praise their gods.","1725":"The Third Wave developed over such a short period of time most likely due to the fact that younger minds and opinions tend to be more flexible, as well as because it was vigorously reinforced. The expirament was ended because it began to develop on its own, making it dangerous for the students to continue to believe that the movement had people's best intirests at heart, as well as the fact that the movement didn't really exist at a relative scale.","1726":"like the pharaoh was the leader he led the social class he ruled egypt he was at the top and most vauled social class next was the visior which would make sure to collect everyones taces and stated in the text next were the middle class  they were market people traders they paid them taxes and then came the slaves they gave the pharaoh almost everything 60% or there harvest to be spicific.","1727":"3 elements of an ideal tragedy described by Aristotle. One element is to imitate actions that excite pity and fear as seen in the second paragraph.

One manner in which they practiced this was by rubbing the meat with soda to take away the smell, as stated in paragraph two.  The workers would also pickle their meat to get rid of the odor but if it was very pungent, they had a second and much stronger pickle which helped destroy the smell, which the workers called, \"giving them thirty per cent.\" Along with this, they would label the packages in many ways to make it look like it was \"original\" even if they were made out of meat parts that were not supposed to be used. Another form in which they would use and cover-up spoiled meat would be by getting spoiled whole ham and old sausage with mold from Europe and dosing it with borax and glycerin, where it would then be dumped into hoppers and made over again for packaging. Mice, feces, poisoned bread, dirt, diseases, and sawdust were just a few things that would be processed in the hoppers along with the spoiled meat. Lastly, they would also use their chemistry department to make sausages appear brown-with the use of borax and colored gelatin- and labeled it \"smoked\" sausage after their practice of smoking sausage became expensive for the factory.  In all, the actions in which the factory practiced were extremely unsanitary and do not appear today thanks to the Meat Inspection Act.

He decided to demonstrate it to his students though an experiment called the third wave.

It quickly spread throughout the school,\u201d by the end of the day the movement had over 200 participants\u201d(3). In just three days the experiment went from 30 students to 200, clearly the students were devoted and eager to join this project. The students were so loyal to this project that they would report to Jones if another student failed to abide by the rules.  Jones began to feel like the experiment was working a bit too well and feared it was getting out of control. The reader is shown this when, \u201cthe students became increasingly involved in the project and their discipline and loyalty to the project was so outstanding that Jones felt it was slipping out of control\u201d(4).

","1738":"The Third Wave developed by emphasizing on simple things first and making sure students followed those actions. Then Jones added more rules and taught students how to take actions. For example, the students intitiated new members and received a special assignment. All of this happened so fast because the students liked being superior. The experiment was ended because the students became increasingly involved in the project and Jones thought that the project was getting out of control so he told them on the fifth day that it was an experimen.","1739":"Three elements of an ideal tragedy are that it should not be arranged not simple but a complex plan.

One way they would do that would be to rub it with soda to take away the smell.  The text also states \"a machine consisting of a hollow needle attached to a pump; by plunging this needle into the meat and working with his foot, a man could fill a ham with pickle in a few secounds.  Though even with this the odar would still be absolutely horrible.  The factories would also cut the spoiled meat and mix it with fresh meat and sell it.  The text also states that they would dose it with borax and glycerin and then dumped in into the hoppers.","1741":"A tragedy must be complex, must be the downfall of a character who is neither good nor bad, but very relatable, and must end giving the audience little pleasure or satisfaction.","1742":"Meat factory workers would prepare rotten and diseased meat with better meats.

The complex plan should excite emotions that make your head spin and make you feel pity as well as fear. A change in fortune helps the tragity move along and keeps you on the edge of your seat as you hope for things to get better. Finally the character should be relatable to some while still being pitiful. This keeps the reader interested as they start to care about the protaganist.","1745":"An ideal tragedy should feature a man that has a downfall, have a complex plan, and have the main character's luck start at good and then go bad. ","1746":"An ideal tragedy, according to Aristotle, has many imporant elements, but three main ones. First, the main character must be a good and relatable figure that has suffered or done something terrible. This is because the audience will connect with the character more, as opposed to a bad character, and more likely to feel fear or pity at their inevitable fate. Next, the plot itself has to go from good to bad. This is a well-constructed plot and  hits the audience strongly. This ties into the last element, a tragic ending. The best tragedies have to end with the character ending unhappy or in a bad situation. This has the most effect on the audience.","1747":"A tradgedy must be the story of a good man whom the audience cn relate by either being just as moral, or more so than the audience. Secondly, the man must encounter a great misfortune not by wickedness, but by a mistake. And thirdly, the ending must be tragic and bring about pity and\/or fear without the merit of anything even bittersweet to redeem moral justice, but only tragic.","1748":"The ideal tradegy will include these 3 elements, it will imitate actions which excite pity and fear.

And families saved the money to send their sons to village schoold to learn trades.  The boys was learned how  to read and write  to gain emplyment in the gvernment.","1752":"The Third Wave developed over such a short period of time through extreme discipline and the idea of an \"authoritarian figure\" (Paragraph 2). Even without the presence of the leader, the students continued to follow the strict rules of the Third Wave. As the students continued to rapidly expand and tighten control of the movement by monitoring each other and reporting all mistakes to the leader, Jones feels as if the movement (which was only suppossed to last a day but ended up lasting three days) had gotten out of control and ends it.","1753":" few ways the factory would cover up spoiled meat were chopping the meat up and turning it into sausage, or put it inside of cans. Another way was after they took the meat out of the pickle and find it was sour and rub it with soda to take away the smell. One other way was dosing the meat with borax and glycerin, and dumped into hoppers.","1754":"The Third Wave developed over a short period of time because of the disipline and since they would salute in class and out of class and since other students saw they wanted to join the crowd and the experiment ended because it got out of hand.","1755":"    The meat factory would use and cover up spoiled meat In maney diffret ways.

Eventually, the students were all doing it, so nobody wanted to be the one to not follow the rules. The kids probably got their friends involved because other kids wanted to join in since their friend was a member.  Also, the kids might have joined because they saw other kids' grades go up. The members of the Third Wave started to grow exponentially.  The experiment ended because it was getting out of hand and he wanted to teach the students about this experiment and how willing they were to follow his rules even out of class.","1757":"They would use chemicals to disguise the smell, chemicals to change the color, cut the meat in such a way to trick buyers, rinse the meat in chemicals before packing it, or dip the meat in pickle juice.

This simply is saying that a good, true tragedy is not a story of someone becoming a hero but rather a hero Becoming a villain. It is all about the downfall not the uprise.  another elemeent of ideal tragedy is the change not to be from bad behavior but rather a mistake that one has made. If the tragedy is expected because of the re, it is not as good as a random downfall off of one mistake.  Lastly an element of ideal tragedy is not when  the person is renowned as good. This is because it shows a balance of not someone who is has evil, but they are also not someone known for being good.","1762":"The first element of an ideal tragedy should be pity in fear, which means when something bad happens to the character, it should make the audience feel bad for them, and be fearful that sometimes this may happen to them\/or fear the fact more bad will be done to the character.

And yet, in spite of this, there would be hams found spoiled, some of them with an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them.

This shows that because the Pharaohs had such a high rank, they had the important tasks. Later in the text, it says, \"At the bottom of the social structure were slaves and farmers. Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war.

Finally to complete the \"perfect tragedy\" it must have a double thread of a plot. A double threaded plot is the opposite of a catastrophe this could go for the good and the bad.

Another factor that caused the development of the Third Wave is the assignment of tasks.

The ending of the story is a result of something terrible.","1874":"Thye would rub it up with soda to take away the smell , how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters; also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose.","1875":"First, \"a perfect tragedy\" should be \"arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan.\" Second, tragedies should \"imitate actions which excite pity and fear.\" Third, the main character should be \"eminently good and just\" and have misfortune brought about not by vice, but instead \"by some error of judgment or frailty.\"","1876":"The main way was the use of chemicals as seen muliptple times thought the passage like \"... back from Europe old sausage that had been rejected, and that was moldy and white \u2013 it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption. \" (Paragraph 4)","1877":"They would turn sausage brown and unscented by filling it with chemicals and dyes (Excerpt from Paragraph 5 below), in order to make the meat look edible and delicious but in reality, it was deadly. They also took old sausage filled with mold and had turned white, they doused it with chemicals over and over again to get it to an \"edible\" point. (Excerpt from Paragraph 3 below). ","1878":"Three elements of an ideal tragedy according to Aristotle are a well-constructed plot, the characters, and a spectacle. A well-constructed plot should be a single issue, and it should be about a change that is good to bad. The characters have to be inbetween the two extremes of success and evil. The character should highly renowned but also could have misfortune. A spectacle is a dramatic or visually striking scene that has to shock the audience. It cannot ne about a bad man passing from adversity to prosperity because it does not move the reader.","1879":"Plot which shoukd be well constructed and only have one issue, character who is not successful and has misfortune then becoming prosperous, diction shouldn't be written by the wishes of the audience and not be of comedy.","1880":"The meat would be found sour and they rub it up with soda to take away the smell to sell it . And yet, in spite of this, there would be hams found spoiled, some of them with an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them. To pump into these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle which destroyed the odor.","1881":"I think it developed so well over a short period of time because the kids were so devoted to it. They had no idea that it was an experiment so they were completely into it. The experiment ended because he realized how big it was and that it was getting out of control. So he gathered all the students and told them it was an experiment that demonstrated how people will follow something and even do horrible things because of it.","1882":"The Third Wave was developed to see how easy it is for people to follow a crowds decisions throughout history. It was proving that democracy has a weakness of having it favor an indivisual rather than groups. The Third Wave was ended because Jones felt it was getting out of control. He ended it by telling the students that the presidential canidate would annoce its ending on TV the next day. ","1883":"The factory covered up the used of  spoiled meat by using different methods to hide it.  The factories would hide the spoiled meat by \" [pickling] which destroyed the odor\" ( Sinclair 1).  The factory would hide the spoiled meat by any means nessacary. This shows how concered the factories were about the health of thier emploies and costumers if they consumed their product.  Another length they went to was  to \" mixed with half a ton of other meat\"( Sinclair 1). When they produce their meat it was very unsantariry, and they let meat go bad ,and then they mixed it with other things to make a profit. Futhermore, the methods used to hide spoiled meats is gross and could cause someone to be extremly sick.  If someone foud modly meat it would be \"dosed with borax and glycerin\" (Sinclair 1).  There standard for quality product is so low companies have resorted to such gross measures. Increasing the odds of someone getting sick and dying from the gross meat. This is how far companies would go to hid spoiled meat. ","1884":"The tragedy must be set on a complex plot based on a single issue. The tragedy should include aspects that imitate the arousing of pity and fear elements in the reader. However, the character's fortune should change from good to bad, as this is will show a reason for pity and fear. There should also be a sense of morality. There would be a tragedy not in the form of vice or some sort of depravity, but instead from a wrong judgment call from the human error that led to bad consequences.","1885":"As mentioned in the text, \"Egyptian society was structured like a pyramid.\" The Pharaoh, who was worshipped as a  god,  was at the peak, with nobles and priests right below.  Below there were viziers, scribes and government officials. Next on the pyramid was soldiers and the middle class. The middle class was made of merchants and craftsmen. Soldiers worked for the government, and the middle class might not have always, joined the government, but at least they weren't at the very bottom. At the very bottom of the pyramid were farmers and slaves. As said by the text, \"A small number of peasants and farmers moved up the social structure.\" this means that once you were in the lower class, it was almost impossible to climb out and become a part of the government. That is the location in the social structure that all people in Egypt were in, and how that affected their chances of being in the government.","1886":"A perfect tragedy should imitate action that exite pity and fear. It should have someone suffer something tragic. Lastly it should have be planned out, not just short and simple.","1887":"Tragedy is never planned and always unexpected. Tragedy makes you feel pity and fear. Tragedy is a change in your life and how you react to that change. ","1888":"The ancient Egyptian system of government was shaped like a pyramid, different classes were located at different places of the pyramid. Slaves and farmers were put at the very bottom.  Pharoahs, nobles, and priests were put  at the very top of the pyramid. Everyone else was put somewhere in the middle. The people at the top could command the people below them.  For example, in paragraph 4 it says \"The pharaoh appointed a chief minister called a vizier as a supervisor. The vizier ensured that taxes were collected.\"  However, the people at the bottom could still work their way up.  This is shown in the text on paragraph 13  when it says \" It was possible for a boy born on a barn to work his way up into the higher ranks of the government.\"","1889":"At the top of the social pyramid are gods.  They had immense power, and could control their respective elements (Paragraph 1). Just below gods are pharaohs. Pharaohs were considered gods in human forms. They also had a load of power (Paragraph 1). Viziers were below pharoahs. The vizier insured taxes were collected. They also acted as a supervisor (Paragraph 4).  Scribes also worked with viziers. They were special, because they could read and write (Paragraph 5). Below all of these people were nobles and priests. Nobles were the only people allowed to hold government posts and profited from tributes paid to the pharoah (Paragraph 6). Priests were the religous leaders of Egypt. They kept the gods content so that they wouldn't bring misfortune to Egypt (Paragraph 6). Soldiers were below those two. They fought in wars and forcibly ended domestic uprisings. When it was peaceful, soldiers supervised peasents, farmers, and slaves who got involved in creating structures like pyramids and palaces (Paragraphs  8-10). Physicians and craftsmen\/women were part of the middle class. They made jewelry, pottery, and papyrus products, tools, and all kinds of useful things (Paragraph 9). Of course, people had to buy good from these people. The people who bought these things were merchants and storepeople. These people sold these goods to the public (Paragraph 10). At the bottom of the barrel, we have slaves and farmers. Slavery was often the fate of prisoners of war. They wre forced to work on building projects, and toiled  at the discretion of the pharaoh or nobles (Paragraph 11)","1890":"The Third Wave developed over such a short period of time because the students were following the leader that they grew to trust and they followed each other in herd like behavior. Over that short period of time, Mr. Jones demonstrated how quickly and effectively he could get that group of students to obey and listen to him at all costs. The text states, \"... they had been a part of an experiment to demonstrate how people willingly create a sense of superiority over others, and how this can lead people to justify doing horrible things in the name of the state\u2019s honor.\" This example shows how the students felt that since they were apart of a group, they were above aanyone else who wasn't in the \n specific group. ","1891":"Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions they profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods.","1892":"They would rub it with soda to take away the smell. In the text it states, \"Also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose.\" They did anything they could to be able to sell the meat regardless if it was spoiled or not. ","1893":"An ideal tragedy should have its main character be someone who is highly renowned and prosperous, one who is not eminently good or bad, and they have an error in their ways or in their judgement that leads to their downfall. The change in the main character's fortune should also turn from good to bad.","1894":"At first the movement just consisted of the students in Mr. Jones class but it soon expanded all across the school because the students liked the idea of not having to think for themselves. Also this experiment made students believe they were apart of something important . Members began to discriminate against the students that had not joined. Members also began reporting to Mr. Jones if they thought another member was going aganist the rules, and the members assaigned themselves jobs that would help further the movement. Overall the experiment was ended because it got out of hand and Mr. Jones believed that the student's didipline and loyalty to the project was so outstanding that it was slipping out of control.","1895":"Skilled workers such as physicians and craftsmen\/women made up the middle class. Craftsmen made and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus\n products, tools, and other useful things.\n\n","1896":"Stated in paragraph 4, \" When the whole ham was spoiled..- no odor that was ever in the ham could make a difference.\" meaning that they didnt care whether it was spoiled, meat was meat to them and nothing would change that.

One method was to use soda to get rid of the rotting smell, \"Jonas had told the, how the meat that was taken out of the pickly would often be found sour, and how they would rub it with soda to take away the smell.\"  Another way they covered up the bad meat was by using a tool that could \"fill a ham with pickle in a few seconds.\"  If the smoked hams were found to have gone bad, they would remove it from the bone and put a white-hot iron in the hole.","1908":"I think they were kind of harsh because if yu were a farmer the governmet made them pay big with there money and they had to pay as much as 60% of there yearly harvest , so a small number of peasents and farmers moved up to the economic ladder , more family's tended to save up there money for there sons village schools to learn about trades.","1909":" to cover up the spoiled meat they would use \n  everything of the pig except the squeal. they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell. they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron.

In Paragraph three he mentions a well-constructed tragedy to be single rather than double. \"Hense they are in error who censure Euripides just because he follows this principle in his plays, many of which end unhappily. It is, as we have said, the right ending.\" (Paragraph 3). In Paragraph four he ends the plan with a perfect tragedy saying, It has an opposite catapsphrphe for the good and bad. \"The pleasure, however, thence derived is not the true tragic pleasure. It is proper rather to Comedy, where those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies.\" (Paragraph 4).","1923":"Three  elements of an ideal tragedy , as discribed by Aristotle are  complex plans in the  writing, not focus on a good or bad character, and for the beginning to start off good and the story end on a bad note.","1924":"One element  is that it should have a double thread of plot.

Specifically, Sinclar reveals the immoral actions that transpired in an attempt to cover up spoiled meat.  Sinclar indicates that the factories covered up spoiled meat through masking odors, reusing rejected meat, and combining normal meat and rat meat simply out of pure laziness. For example, Sinclar states that the meat \"would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption.\" That quote in itself explains one of the many attempts in which the factories hid their corrupt techniques. Additionally, Sinclar incorporates vivid and descriptive imagery to illustrate the masked meatpacking process. Sinclar states, \"There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms, and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of rats would race about on it. It was too dark in these storage places to see well, but a man could run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of the dried dung of rats.\" The explanation regarding the rats and the leaky rooms emphasizes the feeble conditions located in the specific offices. Another way in which the factory workers hid their spoiled meat was by supplementing odorous pickles to the most spoiled portions of meat. This was done in an attempt to mask the stench of the meat. Overall, Sinclar uses tone and imagery to illustrate the corrupt business done by meatpacking workers.

The social class under the pharaoh was the vizier and scribes. The vizier ensured that taxes were collected. Working with the vizier, were scribes. Scribes kept government records.

One of them being that the arrangement of said tragedy should not but simple, but instead be on a more complex front. Another element is that the tragedy itself should tantalize emotions such as pity and fear out of us, and not aim for merely shock value.  Another element he seems to jest to is that of it being relatable and in that same sense, it must be likeable, as a character that we don't relate to or like will not grasp out of the audience the proper reaction that is sought out. A following element should also fall to be that the plot is focused on a single issue instead of two or more. There should also be an element that is a change of fortune from good to bad, and not bad to good.

This plan should excite the audience but also scare them. Tragedy's that are capable of doing this are really just an imitation.  Aristotle states, \"It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear,\" (2). The main character of a tragedy also is critical to its plot. The main character should never be a god or anyone extremely high in power, or a very bad man. Rather a reliable person for the readers to find attributes similar to their own.  \" Nor, again, that of a bad man passing from adversity to prosperity: for nothing can be more alien to the spirit of Tragedy; it possesses no single tragic quality,\"(2). A plot should also not be the main focus of the tragedy rather the fight from the 2 extremes.","2057":"The third wave was developed over a short period of time because because Jones made himself the authoritan figure. Ater doing this by giving the class simple tasks and making sure they were welly disiplened, he started giving them task that were noticable to the public. This made students from all over the school want to join. Students apart of the third wave also got member cards and special assiments that stuck out to nonmembers and other students because some were denied to become a member. The experiment ended because the students became to involved in the project and their loyalty and discipline to the project was emaculate.

It should be relatable for the audience to relate to the tragic life of a common virtuous man who is neither bad nor good. This common man has to make a tragic mistake that the audience can feel a cathartic experience in the sense that the events that occur are not all one-sided but rather a creation of simple mistakes. Aristotle also highlights that the complex plot be something that is focused on comedy or second rank tragedies, but rather it should be something he describes as true tragic pleasure. True tragic pleasure is one that works out an ending where it ends unhappily and dramatically, after it's been constructed efficiently.

The 2nd element  should be about the plot of the tragedy, what is going on, instead of the story focusing on multiple issues, it should have 1 issue to focus.  But it also shouldn't go from bad to good because at that point it wouldn't count as a tragedy since the issue was resolved.

Skilled workers and soldiers were up in the middle class, while slaves and farmers are at the bottom of the pyramid.","2082":"There were many ways the factory would use to hinder the condition of the spoiled meat. One of the various ways the factory would cover up spoiled meat was by rubbing the meat against soda to get rid of the odor.

Another way the factory covered up the spoiled meat was encorporating glycerin and borax from sausage rejected from Europe-suggesting the conditions of the spoiled meat were noticeable. According to paragraph 3 \"it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption.\" Signyfying this was a repeated process to get the sausage accepted to other countries.  Furthermore, the factory would hide the spoiled meat by \"giving them thirty-percent\" which was done prior to finding hams spoiled from injection.

After this invention there was no longer Number One, Two, and Three Grade\u2014there was only Number One Grade.\" This conveys that the factory narrowed down the techniques used to hinder the spoileld condition of the meat first done by intensyfing the amount of pickle to hide the smell to creating devices and apparatuses that extracted the \"bad parts\" (which created the condition) of the meat, in this case the bone.

Nobles could hold government posts and priests had to please the gods.

Aristotle wrote, \"it should moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation\" (2). He not only states that it should create the feeling of pity and fear, but also states that these two feelings are distinctive marks of tragedies. This helps to explain why he stresses how the story should change, \"not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad\" (3). Tragedies are supposed to be sad and make the reader feel bad for the character which a story from good to bad does, while a story from bad to good  expresses the feeling of achievement and reshapes for the better. Lastly he describes the element of how misfortune is not brought by, \"Vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty\"(2). He said the character can't be a villain because this wouldn't be a tragedy and the person couldn't be someone known for being good. It must be a renowned and prosperous person whose misfortune happens because he makes a wrong judgment or bad choice instead of something they have always done like a habit.

Next in power was the Nobles and the priest the nobles were government and the  priest  God Pleasers. soldiers, merchants and Craftsmen fell into the middle class in which they protected the land and people as well as being creators of goods. and at the bottom was slaves and farmers the largest at least powerful level of the social structure they were the laborers.","2442":"Egyptian society had a very interesting type of government all including the Pharaohs, Nobles, tributes which were all under the power of the Pharaohs and were both in charge of keeping the Pharaoh pleased, and entertained... they also had other people like farmers that gave gifts to the Pharaohs aka their gods because Pharaohs were believed to be for like gods that were sent here to look after the people there, and farmers paid taxes with food, and incase of a economical disorder they could have food if it was too expensive for them if they went in war or into a devastating economical hit you also had soldiers which were under farmers and they had to take care of the whole city and look after Pharaohs tombs making sure that nobody got into them, and making sure that nothing was being unfair in their city however many things were still unfair in the city since soldiers thought that they were the ones the lead the city and it kept things unbalanced, and then you have the slaves these people were most likely never going to get out of being a slave, and speaking of which its already pretty rare to move up places in the egyptian goverment especially as a slave so these people were forced to work, and to work without having much food and being tortured these people didn't really ever have a happy ending however in some ways they do because if they die they don't have to live through all the torture that they went through, in other words if you are a slave you better you get lucky and move up to be a soldier to atleast have decent respect in the city, and to be able to go out and do stuff oh and, the wives of the soldiers were kept in their homes, and could not go out they could only go out after the soldier had returned from work or returned from war or whatever they ordered him to do, and its said that women had to wear a metal contraption on their hips so when the soldiers were out for work or were out for war they had to wear these things so the women could not cheat, and if they were caught cheating they would be tortured and killed, and men that wanted to fight other men were forced to fight but if they lost they had to get one of their toes or fingers cut off, and did not get any medical attention afterwards if you did get an infection you would most likely die judging by them not having much medicine to heal themselves or any type of alcohol to disinfect their cuts or anything... in conclusion many of the egyptian societies had pretty weird rules, and governments...

They would also pickle the meat so it would cover the smell of the rotten meat.","2455":"An ideal tragedy, according to Aristotle, involves the following: misfortune of a man who is neither good nor evil,  a change from good fortune to bad, and the misfortune should come from an error made by the character. ","2456":"An ideal tragedy must have a relateable hero, a singular plot, and a plot where the hero's own human flaws cause their demise. This is exemplified by Aristotle's description of the ideal tragic hero. Paragraph 2 states, \"There remains, then, the character between these two extremes \u2014 that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous \u2014 a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such families.\" It's imperative to understand that the protagonist of a Greek tragedy and their qualities are some of the defining traits of a tragedy. The protagonist has to speak to a common humanity within the audience in order to have maximum emotional appeal and impact.  The audience will only be distressed at the events the hero is subject to if they can cry with him and relate  to them just like any person. If the protagonist is either someone incredibly saint-like that never makes mistakes that result in conflict or outrageously and comedically evil that succeeds because of their malevolence, the audience will not be able to see themselves in the hero because such drastic personalities or situations rarely happen in real life. Because the fundamental plot elements seem fantastical, the audiene will feel more removed from the play and will not feel the pain as the hero feels it when they fail, or the triumphance when they succeed. The best way to make a hero human to the audience is to give them nuance. Like most people, the tragic hero should generally strive to do good but get caught up by their own mistakes like pride, anger, lack of judgement, etc. so that they aren't bad people but still accountable for their mistakes. It's essential to make tragic heroes essentially common men that the audience already identifies with (such as honorable nobility who are still humans without any special or divine powers) who have relateable motivations and qualities that cause them to fail due to their own actions while still being sympathetic people. Since this reminds the audience of themselves, it will feel all the more tragic when they suffer, which is the point of the tragic play. In order to have the optimal amount of misery, the plot should be singular. This is discussed in paragraphs 3 and 4, which state, \"He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous \u2014 a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such families. ...In the second rank comes the kind of tragedy which some place first. Like the Odyssey, it has a double thread of plot, and also an opposite catastrophe for the good and for the bad. ...It is proper rather to Comedy, where those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies \u2014 like Orestes and Aegisthus \u2014 quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain.\" This text demonstrates how one single serious plot is necessary for a proper tragic play. A true tragedy must have the complex protagonist endure general failure as well as the associated physical and emotional pain due to their own incorrect actions, and this should be the only plot point in the play to prevent distractions. On the other hand, double plots  often resolve positively without events like major character death or conflict. The idea that the protagonist does not have to endure any of the consequences of their actions and suffer as a result is the complete antithesis of a tragedy. As a result, the audience does not reach catharsis because there are no emotional stakes if everything is fixed by the end. Therefore, they have no lasting negative emotions pertaining to the play.","2457":"It should be  a complex plan that also excites fear and pity, change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity.","2458":"For ham, it would either be pickled more, had the bone takin out, or mixed with other meat. \"It was only when the whole ham was spoiled that it came into the department of Elzbieta.

Secondly, they picked meats by injecting picling juice into the hams, but if the hams were spoild they would inject a different, stronger pickling juice into the ham to cover up the smell and the flaver of the soiled meat as shown in this quote, \"And yet, in spite of this, there would be hams found spoiled, some of them with an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them. To pump into these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle which destroyed the odor\u2014a process known to the workers as 'giving them thirty per cent.'\" Another way the workers would get rid of odors if the rot was situated around a bone, is that they would use a machine that removed the bone and replaced it with a white hot iron. Lastly, the workers would take all meat that was too rotten to be fixed with any of the other solutions and grind it up to add to the sausages.","2470":"   Ancient Egypt aranged its classes into a pyramid. At the top you would see the higher valued roles, and less valued roles at the bottom. These roles could change but it is very difficult to move up, as it says in the text.","2471":"    The ideal tragedy should include a multi-dimensional conflict, a neutral character's mistake, and that character's fortune turning from good to bad. A conflict that only has one tragic trait is not a tragedy, since it will not have enough dimension to provoke the emotions within an audience that are associated with tragedy, since this kind of conflict \"never satisfies the moral sense nor calls forth pity or fear\" due to its basic nature (\"On Tragedy\"). Therefore, the writer(s)  should include multiple traits that build up to form the many different pillars that make a tragedy, since tragedies rarely occur because of a single tragic trait. To follow this conflict outline, the main character in a tragedy should be neither good nor bad, and their misfortune should occur due to a mistake that they've made. This is because \"pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves,\" meaning that it will be easier for the audience to feel pity and empathize with a character if they can see themselves in that character's shoes (\"On Tragedy\"). The character's fortune should also change from good to bad, since this will reflect the same pity in the audience that was aforementioned. When it comes down to why the target feeling is pity, that's because pity is the leading feeling that audiences have when reacting to tragedies. After all, tragedies are defined as \"great suffering, destruction, and distress,\" and these types of situations always have emotional consequences (Oxford Dictionary). If a tragedy is unsuccessful in provoking the emotions that come with tragedy, then it clearly would not be the ideal tragedy. ","2472":"In the first section he says that \" A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan\". what he is saying is that sometimes the best tragedys are the ones that the readers are least to expect. this can easily be done by having a build up of some specific characters and have the audience thinking the end will work in the favor of one of the most beloved people in the plot. this is even done in modern times with shows like Game Of Thrones, it in its self pretty much proves his point because the end of the show took many people by surprise and they werent happy with the outcome.

After a few days, the movement expanded from the initial 30 students to over 200 students, and students had started to report when other members failed to follow the rules (showing their desire for superiority). In the end, Jones felt that he was losing control of the experiment since the students were becoming increasingly involved, so he revealed to the students that the entire Third Wave was just an experiment to show how people wrongly justify unmoral actions by connecting them to their pride and patriotism.","2479":"Egypt's system of government had a social structure.

Mr.Jones had to stop the experiment because students stared taking it way to serious. In paragraph 3 it says \"Jones was surprised that some of the students started reporting to him when other members of the movement failed to abide by the rules.\" The kids started to tell on each other trying to get others in trouble for not following \"the rules.\"  Who knows how far some of those kids might have taken it.","2481":"As described by Aristotle three ideal tragedy elements include a complex plot, a change of fortune from good to bad, and  a character that is not good or bad.

I know this because in the text that I cited from, the author states multiple scenarios where people of all classes are needed for a functioning government. One of those scenarios that the author states are when soldiers, most commonly part of the middle-class by my guess, go off to war.  Another example that the author says in the text is when farmers, a part of the bottom class, tend their fields, raised their animals, and more. Ancient Egyptians would not be able to live without farmers, because they grew and raised plenty of food.

The third element of an ideal tragedy is that at the end, the problem is resolved, and the fighting and violence stop. ","2627":"Rubbing meat with soda would take away the foul smell.

They are slaves because they were captured and forced to do work.

Next to the gods was the pharoah. paragraph two states that ancient Egyptian \"leaders, called pharaohs, were believed to be gods in human form.\" People called nobles benifited from gifts to the pharaoh. After nobles came priests, who made sure the gods were happy. If the gods weren't happy, they could bring floods and other natural disasters. While the pharoahs were given a lot of power, they were also given a lot of rensponsibilty. The pharoah had to command the army and deal with taxes, which they hired a vizier for. The vizier made sure that taxes were collected. paragraph five states that \"working with the vizier were scribes\". The scribes were the only people who knew how to read and write, and they were in charge of the government records.  Soldiers were next on the social pyramid of ancient Egypt. They protected the country and made sure it was safe in case a conflict broke out.  Craftsmen created useful items like tools and pottery. In addition to these things, craftsmen also made luxury items such as jewelry.  At the very bottom of the social pyramid there were farmers and slaves.  Farmers took care of fields and animals, made sure canals and reservoirs were in good order, worked in stone quarries, and built royal monuments.

They had little care for the condition of the meat or a sanitized way to store it. They shipped meat from other countries and when it was found moldy they would dose it \"with borax and glycerin\"(Sinclair par. 3). The only thing they worried about was shipping and reciveing meat.

A tragedy also must have intimate language and actions that engage the readers and excite pity and fear. The language and actions bring different ambiances and excitement throughout. The language should be pleasant and easily understood by the audience. A tragedy must have true tragic endings and not resemble comedies.

Pity is \"aroused by unmerited misfortune,\" while fear is aroused by that misfortune being experienced by a character relatable to the audience. Therefore, the character can not be perfect in virtue, but have some tragic personality flaws, as that would make him unrelatable.

Plot should give a single issue and not double and should be from good to bad in terms of change of fortune. The fortune should come as a result of error in a character from better to worse and imitate pity and fear. Character should be defiant of a bad man passing from adversity to prosperity from the spirit of Tragedy and possess no tragic qualities and related to the audience to create emotions. Diction or choice of words should be arranged in a simple, but complex plan and imitate actions of pity and fear, while also thoroughly satisifing moral sense and well-being. Evidence to support these statements are in paragraphs 2 and 3 where it reads, \" A plot of this kind would, doubtless, satisfy the moral sense, but it would inspire neither pity nor fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves...A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain. The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse... the character between these two extremes \u2014 that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty...A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan. It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation. It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity.\" These pieces of evidence further support my assertion of the three main elements of an ideal tragedy being plot, character, and diction by showing the importance of a plot and its significance of portraying pity and fear and character and its importance of showing one's personality to be from adversity to prosperity, while showing the significance of diction and its well-being of providing a sense of pity and fear and satisying moral sense throughout the play and tragedy in its choice of words.","2876":"They would rub the meat with soda to take away the smell.

According to Aristotle, a tragedy should, \"morover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear,\" (Paragraph 2). He then goes on to show explain how an author can initiate these feelings in the audiance through specific characters and their mistfourtunes. Aristotle also goes on to say that the protagonist in a tragedy should not be someone who is perfect and saint-like, but it also should not be someone who is evil. He says, \"There remains, then, the character between these two extremes-that of a man who is not emminently good and just, yet whose mistfourtune is brough about not by vice,\" (Paragraph 2).  The final element that, accodring to Aristotle, makes an ideal tragegy is the change of fourtune. He says, \"the change of fourtune should not be from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad,\" (Paragraph 3). If the main character were to have a happy ending, then the drama would closer resemble a comedy rather than a tragedy. In summary, according to Aristotle, nuetral characters, a bad change in fourtune, and the ability to excite pity and fear are all elements of an ideal tragedy.

Another element of an ideal tragedy is the story should be well thought out and much effort should be put into it. \"A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan\" (p2) meaning that for a story to be the perfect tragedy it should be though through well.  Lastly a tragedy should be on a basis of \"Alcmaeon, Oedipus, Orestes, Meleager, Thyestes and Telephus\" (P3).

The protagonist begins the story with good luck, then ends it with bad luck (and vice versa, in the antagonist's case). The most vital aspect of a tragedy is its ending. Tragedies must end unhappily. The hero must suffer a horrible ending and the villain is encouraged to prosper (or at least to win). This is to arouse deep seated feelings of fear and pity in the audience, feelings that they are usually disconnected with and tragedies were created to help the audience regulate their (often repressed) negativity by connecting with and learning from the protagonist's fate.

I know this because it said \"the meat that was taken out of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell.\" A way that the factory would use spoiled meat was they would mix rat, bread, and spoiled meat and put all of them together.

The change of fortune should be from good to bad due to a poor decision made by the character.","2940":"What I can infer from my understanding of the article is that, the factories wer absolutely and horribly disgusting.

Rubbing soda to cover some smell, mixing with unspoiled meat so the taste wasn't so bad, dosed with borax and glycerin, and many more reasons why the meat industry was putrid in it's smell, health, and cleanliness. In paragraph  3 we see, \"Europe old sausage that had been rejected, and that was moldy and white \u2013 it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption.\" This shows us how if something had expired or went bad, factories would apply chemicals to regain the look of freshness.

That would make the idea of there being a lack of more addition to the tragedy. The last component is that when it comes to the change of fortune, the order should go from good to bad and this is because that would be seen as better than it going the other way.","3138":"The structure of the ancient Egyptian system of government was Egyptians believed that the gods controlled the universe. therefore it was important to keep them happy.

Finally, the most atrocious method they used would be how they dealt with vermin that contaminated their meat. They would poison bread which would kill the vermin, but they also mixed the dead rats and poisoned bread with the new meat, effectively doing nothing to solve the problem.

This shows that, instead of throwing away old or spoiled meat, they would can it, or make it into sausages. Another example is when Sinclair is talking about how they never pay attention to what was put in to sausage, and then says \"that was mold and white - it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers. and made over again for home consumption\" (Sinclair 3).

This would allow the audience to envision themselves in the character's place bringing about the emotions of pity and fear of such events that may in the future be presented to themselves.

Meat that had an odor was rubbed down with soda to remove the stinch. The meat industry used chemisty to give meat of any color, smell, or size its color or smell to disguise the true nuaseating ingredients.

They each had their our differences on what they did. Pharaohs were the most powerful, they  did many different things. They directed the army of Egypt in case of war.  They also made all of the laws, they also held all the farmers crops (specificly grains) that they paid from taxes in a large warehouse incase there was ever a time of famine.  The viziers had less power than the pharaohs. The viziers did do an inportant thing though. They make sure all the taxes came in from all the Egyptians. They also kept goverment records.

In paragraph 2, Aristotle explained, \"imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation.\" This shows that a good balance of pity and fear brings the emotions out of the audience.  The second element is there should only be one issue. This issue should be good to bad because it brings out the most tragedy in plays. The third element is the main character should have a change from good to bad. ","3208":"The three elements of an ideal tragedy are plot, character, and  spectacle.

The characters must be, \"...highly renowned and prosperous...\" as said by Aristotle meaning that they should be well off and known people who have a downfall.

Another way meat would be better was to \"[dose it] with borax and glycerin\" (paragraph 3).

","3215":"There was a machine that would be used to inject the meat with pickle, which was a perservitive (paragraph 2). The main part of the meat that spoiled the fastest was right around the bone, so they would take that part out and replace it with a hot iron (paragraph 2). Old sausage would come back from Europe and would be moldy and white. To cover this up they would cover it in borax and glyserin (paragraph 3).  The meat that was \"smoked\" was just covering in borax and colored with geliton to make it look smoked. This was done because smoking the meat took time and money the meat packing plant did not want to use.","3216":"    The third wave had developed over such a short period of time because the class had good discipline and showed the students that they were leaders.

The Third Wave experiment had ended because Jones felt it was slipping out of control. In this short story it says how Jones lied to the students saying how it was Nationwide.

This will effectively arouse pity and fear in the audience, as opposed to a man going from adversity to prosperity, because this does not possess tragic qualities or induces pity or fear.","3221":"The Third Wave developed in such a short period of time because the students were required to do certain actions in the classroom and were assigned to do them outside of class as well. In the 2nd paragraph it states \"Jones started the first day of the experiment emphasizing simple things like proper seating, and drilld the students extensively until they got it right.

One major element he describes is that it must \"excite pity and fear\".  Aristotle states and centers all of his other arguments around the tragedy actually producing fear or pity. For example, further down the text he states 'it neither satisfies the moral sense nor calls forth pity or fear.\" Another element that is described by Aristotle is that main character must have a change of fortune. Aristotle states that \"...the spectacle of a virtous man brought from prosperity to adversity...\" and says that the character \"whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depraviry, but by some error of judgement or frailty.\" Aristotle believed that the character needed to have a change of fortune which he believed should be from good to bad and it needed to be because of himself. Another element expressed by Aristotle is that tragedies should have a bad or unhappy ending. He states \"Hence they are in error who censure Euripides just because he follows this principle in his plays, many of which end unhappily. It is, as we have said, the right ending.\" He believed that ideal tragedies should end unhappily, excite fear and pity, and have a change of fortune.","3224":"They would rub the meat with soda to take away the smell.

Jones ended the experiment after only four days because he felt the loyalty he was gaining and the discipline the students were showing was growing out of hand.","3248":"At least three elements of an ideal tragedy include imitating actions exciting pity and fear, it should be of certain construction, and should weaken the spectators by the wishes of the audience. Imitating actions exciting pity and fear marks a tragic imitation and changes the fortune presented which shocks the audience. Being of certain construction makes the tragedy perfect, adding drama makes the tragedy more tragic. Weakening the spectators by the wishes of the audience can be used to add a double thread to the plot. To make it even better, an opposite catastrophe.","3249":" All laws were enacted at the discretion of the pharaoh.

He believes that the plays that have a bad ending for the main character are the most tragic in effect. Another element Aristotle thinks is important is having a main character that is not either a full-on villain or completely virtuous. This is because he thinks the downfall of a viruous man would simply shock the audience, while the downfall of a villain would satisfy the morals of the audience, but not cause them to feel pity or fear. The last element is that the main character's turn of fate shouldn't be brought about by immoral behavior, but instead by a great error or frailty. If a man's turn of fate was brought about through purely immoral reasons, the audience might think that he deserves it and not feel any pity for him.","3253":"The factory would use the whole animal, they even used spoiled meat and other items to give it any color, any taste, and any odor. \"also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose. \" ","3254":"All the social class were treated differently because the upper class was  the most powerful and had the most resources and the middle class were the most skilled so they got plently of resources but for the lower class they got less resources.","3255":"One way is they just put anything they wanted and smooshed it up into sausage.

Second, the change of misfortune shouldn't be the spectacle of a man who is brought down from wealth to misfortune because it doesn;t arouse the feelings of pity or misfortune. Lastly, the downfall of a character shouldn't be brought down by vice, but by some error of judgment or frailty.

He started the experiemnt small, by inviting students to join a movement title. 'The Third Wave\", which aimed to bring down democracy. The movement stared out small in his classroom, by having kids pratice proper seating and abide by strict rules with him as their leader. Jones noticed that as the week went on, students had \"a supreme sense of discipline and community\" (CommonLit Staff) and even followed the Nazi-like salute Jones had made up. By the third day, the movement had tons of students involved all of whom showed, \"a drastic improvment in academic skills and tremendous motivation\" (CommonLit Staff). All members were issued a member card and given a specific task\/assignment to honor the movement. As members started to learn how to recruit more people, membership increased to over 200 students. They asked questions in three words or less and prefaced all their statments with \"Mr.Jones\". By the experiment's fourth day, Jones saw an alarming amount of loyalty and dedication to the movement. So much, that he knew he had to shut it down, before it got out of control. To reveal that the whole movement had been an experiment, Jones convinced his students that a presidential candidate of the nationally-recognized movement was publicly announcing it's existence on T.V., and ordered them all to a noon rally on Friday. When the students got to the rally, all they saw was a blank screen. Jones revealed that they had been part of an experiment to show how quickly people will join a group to prove their superiorety over others or have a sense of community no matter the type of community. He also explained how people will excuse any actions as contribution to the movement or classify it for \"the name of the state's honor\" (CommonLit Staff). He had to shut the experiment down because the movement was getting ot of control and people were involving themselves into something that they knew little about. As people started to gain a false sense of confidence in the movement, they excused weird and controlled behaviors in the name of the movement.

Soldiers could be considered in the class lower than gods and pharaohs because they had to protect them and when not fighting as paragraph 8 states, \"During long periods of peace soldiers also supervised the peasants, farmers, and slaves who were involved in building such structures as pyramids and palaces.\" The middle clas was made up of merchants, jewlers, pottery makers, shopkeepers, and craftsmen\/women. All provided services that were essential or looked pretty. Finally, at the lowest end there were slaves and farmers. Slaves worked hard at the pharaohs or nobles will and were treated terribly.

Only nobles could hold government positions, and priests were responsible for appeasing the gods. Soldiers were beneath the nobles and priests but supervised slaves and farmers at the bottom of the system. According to the text, \"Social mobility was not impossible.

Their leaders, which are pharohs, have ultimate power over the people. Because people believed that pharohs were godlike, they trusted their leaders with their life. I know this because in the text it says \"Egyptian society was structured like a pyramid. At the top were the gods, such as Ra, Osiris, and Isis. Egyptians believed that the gods controlled the universe. Therefore, it was important to keep them happy. They could make the Nile overflow, cause famine, or even bring death. The Egyptians also elevated some human beings to gods. Their leaders, called pharaohs, were believed to be gods in human form. They had absolute power over their subjects. After pharaohs died, huge stone pyramids were built as their tombs. Pharaohs were buried in chambers within the pyramids.

It is just \"unmerited misfortune\" which the audience can relate to. The third element is that the play\/poem has the correct ending.

In paragraph 2, he states, \"...imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation. It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man...\"  Here he states that the tragedy should show complex characters with a complex storyline so the audience can feel different emotions that should be felt in a tragedy, such as pity and fear. The second element of a tragedy is that the plot should contain a man neither good nor evil whose life falls apart from a mistake. A character should not move from pure happiness to pure misfortune, or vise versa. For example, in paragraph 2, Aristotle states, \"...here remains, then, the character between these two extremes \u2014 that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous...\" Throughout the paragraph Aristotle shows that a character should fall in between good and evil, which in turn can evoke more emotion in the audience rather than merely being shocked. The third element of a tragedy is that the complex storyline and plot should have the character's fortune go from good to bad, because of a greater mistake created. Aristotle continues to mention this throughout paragraph 3 as the ending should always be in misfortune or unhappiness. This is truly defined as a tragedy because of  how these types of common endings surprise the audience as it might be something unexpected.","3532":"  The structure of the social classis very organized.

And the scribe were people who wrote recorded goverment records and recorded history.  And then the third people we will be talking about are the nobles and priests. Nobles could hold goverment posts and they made money by the gifts for the pharoh. The priests were recpected in this society because they \" were responsible for pleasing the gods\". Next we have the soldiers who fought in wars or stopped uprisings. And in the middle of the social class we hav physicians and craftsmen\/woman. Craftsmen made pots paper and jewlery and tools and other things. then we have the merchanta and storekeppers who sold things. A nd last but not least, in the bottom of the social class are the farmers and slaves. Slaves were prisoners of a war or some were captured. Farmers had fields raised animals and \"kept canals and reservoirs in good order, worked in the stone quarries, and built royal monuments.\" This is the social class of Ancient Egypt.","3533":"it is like a pyrimid lower class on the bottem has the most population so it is the biggest part and so on and so on.Just it is like a pyrimid .","3534":"A tragedy can both be a good and bad thing, it can lead to the downfall of a hero or be somewhat comicle.

Furthermore, a tragedy should incite feelings of pity and fear, and these feelings should be incited without cliche. Lastly, there should never be a downfall of a villian -- and instead the downfall of a well-regarded person and must be on the account of wrong judgement or fraility.","3656":"The structure of the ancient Egyptian system of government is summarized by explaining how it works, and then they talk about who is in charge in paragraph 2 and who is in labor in paragraph 11.

As it states in the text, \"Each farmer paid taxes in the form of grains, which were stored in the pharaoh\u2019s warehouses.  The vizier ensured that taxes were collected.\" This shows, people had to do their taxes because they worked if you work you pay and do taxes. Wealth, jobs, and income are all part of social classes. Therefore, in this text it explains how different social classes were contributed in this government.","3662":"At the top of the the egyptian social structure were the slaves and farmers. The slaves were war prisoners and were used for building projects. They were the lowest of low in egypt. \"Slaves toiled at the discretion of the pharaoh or nobles\" (11).  The ''middle class\" of the eqyptian social structure were the Vizers, scribes, nobles, and preists. The preists ran the schools and the nobles help government post. The scribes were the only citizens who could read and write, or even manage to try to learn how to. Vizers were cheif minister who assisted the pharoahs. They ensured taxes were collected. Then at the top of the social structure, there were the Gods and Pharoahs. Everyone looked up to them and wanted to please them. Pharoahs were gods in human form, so they were in change of protecting egyptian citizens and being prepared for a famine. The gods were at the top of the list, they were believed to \"control the universe\". They could bring famine, make the Nile overflow, and even bring death. So it was very important to keep them happy. ","3663":"Each person had a different role. For instance, people were either scribes, pharohs, slaves,farmers, artisans, or priests. At the top of he pyrimad was the pharoh, because the egyptians believed that the pharohs were gods in human form. The text states in paragraph 2 \"pharaohs, were believed to be gods in human form. \" This shows how pharohs were at the top of the social strucure and how the egyptians thought they were important.

Jones emphasized to his students that following this new regime would make them stronger people, encouraging them to take part in it. Additionally, he required them to salute each other outside of his watch, which they did because they felt a motive to do so. After a short while, since just 30 people decided to take part, over 100 more students joined in to be apart of what seemed \"superior\".  Jones eventually had to end the experiment to show the students how they had began to justify their actions towards other students in the name of the Third Wave. Overall, the entire point of the experiment was to make the students realize how quickly individuals strive to be superior over others and follow a crowd so, to get them to realize this, Jones had to end the experiment.

From the text it's shown that the workers would use baking soda to take away the strong odor of the sour meat, and even used chemistry to give it a more fresh taste and odor. This method saved the company money, but was wrong because it was selling people spoiled meat that could possibly make them sick. In paragraph 2 it also states, \"... some of them with an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them. To pump into these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle with destroyed the odor--a process known to the workers as 'giving them thirty percent'\" (Sinclair par.2). When the stench from the meat was bad enought workers would also use a machine to fill the meat with pickle to help rid of the odors. They would use much stronger pickle, and still end up selling the spoiled meat. In the end, the ways they would cover up the spoiled meat is by using baking soda, pickle, or chemistry to help rid of the odors to sell spoiled meat to consumers. ","3683":"The Third Wave developed over such a short period of time because the kids in class and other kids at the school joined in.

This quote showed that the growth may not have started rapidly, but later the text says that the group eventually had 200 members. One of the ways this was possible was that outside of class, students used the salute, intriguing those not involved and eventually allowing more people to join. Most people give in to peer pressure, but when everyone around you is doing something, isn't it hard to not do that same thing as well? The experiment proved this simply with a fake group, and one person starting the wave with a few instructions grew to 200 people following those same instructions. The experiment had to be ended simply because it grew out of control. Something so big could turn bad easily if let loose.","3686":"Some of the ways factories would use spoiled meat is by: mixing it with other meat and turning it into sausage or even using soda to \"conceal\" the rotting smell of it.

By the fourth day, the students were so involved in the project that Ron Jones felt it was \"slipping out of control\" (Paragraph 4). Eventually, he showed the students a \"televised address\" that turned out to be a blank channel and explained to them the ideas of the experiment.

In the text it says the meat couldn't be used for anything else so sausage was their last resort. Another way they covered up spoiled meat was by using chemicals. In the text it says \"Jonas had told them how the meat that was taken out of picle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters; also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose.\" This goes to show chemicals played a role in the process, but not only did they make it into sausage and use chemicals, they also would pump the meat. Over time the factory gained control over a second pickle one much stronger than the first and this one got rid of the odor of the meat completely making the price rise thiry cents because the meat didn't smell. Although the meat was already contaminated and spoiled enough, they even furthered and used the skin of the oldest hogs. This skin wasn't very appealing to the eye or probably the sense of touch so they would chop it up into finer pieces and call it \"head cheese\". The last process of the factory occured when the meat was completely spoiled mold and all.

Thirdly, the plot should be simple. Decent person loses everything by their own mistake. The end. \"In the second rank comes the kind of tragedy which... has a double thread of plot, and also an opposite catastrophe for the good and for the bad.\" Aristotle also mentions how the \"bad guy\" shouldn't be punished on-play as \"a plot of this kind would, doubtless, satisfy the moral sense, but it would inspire neither pity nor fear...\" To arouse pity and fear is the goal of a tragedy for Aristotle.","3707":"Different social classes were involved in the government by having the lower classes do harder work, and the higher classes with more people usually had hard, but more important work.

During long periods of peace, soldiers also supervised the peasants, farmers, and slaves who were involved in building such structures as pyramids and palaces.\" This evidence supports that different social classes were involved in the government by having lower classes do harder work, and the people with the higher classes usually had hard, but more important work.","3708":"The Egyptian government is completely centered around the current pharaoh, and the gods.

Under the pharohs, were the pharohs second in command, known as viziers. They were the people that had to record if taxes were collected. They are supposed to help the pharohs with his duties. Finally, the last social class within the government are the nobles. They are the only class that can hold government positions. They gained money through the tributes, or gifts paid to the pharaoh. Since we know the pharoh was basically a god, they were either paying to him or the other core gods of their society, which included Ra, Osiris and Isis. Every egyptian, including \"pharaohs to farmers\u2014gave gifts to the gods,\" (Paragraph 7.) Moving on, different social classes were involved in the government due to taxation and bueraucracy. For instance, although the pharohs and state leaders held control over what the laws were,  people could still choose whether they wanted these laws or not. Additionally, an example of a different social class being involved in the government were farmers. Farmers were taxed up to 60% of their crop to the pharohs annually, (Paragraph 12.) This allowed the pharohs and nobles to distribute foods from warehouses if need be, such as in a famine or food shortage. Therefore, this is how the social structure of Egypt was built, as well as how other social classes helped within the government.","3733":"They would stick hot irons in spoiled ham to make it less noticable, mix spoiled meat with rotten meat and sell it off, rub meat with chmicals to make it last longer, etc.","3734":"it should be relatable to the common man or something that could happen in there life. it should go from good to bad and not the other way so that the story develops right and last it could have a catastrophe where lots of people die or it could end with no one dead but there not in a good place.

Such as characters, the set up of the movie or play, how they dress and sound and other things along that line. Spectacle can occur in tragedy because everything isn't as it seems.

The plot itself should not simply tell the series of events that occur in the story. Rather, it should focus on how the story can be presented in a way to evoke emotions from the audience, such as pity and fear. The characters in a tragedy should also not start from a spot of despair and work towards success. While a basic development from fortune to adversity would also not be ideal for a tragedy, adding more complexity to this story and including aspects that encourage fear or pity would contribute to developing an ideal tragedy. The construction of how the characters reach their final downfall is also a significant element of an ideal tragedy. For instance, not only should a character have a level of relatability to them, but they should also meet their downfall in a unfortunate and undeserving manner. Often, the story should be planned out so that the character goes into ruin despite their morals or intentions.

Reading further into the story Aristotle also believed that a perfect tragedy should involve actions containing pity or actions of fear, in paragraph two it also states, \"It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation\" (Aristotle 2). Further, into paragraph two, it informs the readers by saying, \"There remains, then, the character between these two extremes \u2014 that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgment or frailty\" (Aristotle 2).

The Nazis had no real idea what was going on, they just followed orders because that is how they were trained. Jones soon realized that students were taking this experiment way farther than he had expected, especially since the class went from 30 to 43 in only three days. by the fourth day the students had shown great loyalty to the project and Jones was getting worried.

This is supported within the passage in paragraph 2 where it states, \"A perfect tragedy should...be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan.\" This quote by Aristotle is comprehending the purpose of the passage to build up the ideal tragedy, and to make the experience for the audience more interesting and worth-while to bring about analogies and comparison on the greatness of tragedies, in general. Another element of an ideal tragedy, according to Aristotle, is the use of pity and fear through imitation of certain actions from which  is a persuasive technique used to bring in the audience for more and feel compassion for the main character being affected at hand. Evidence from the text to support this statement is near the beginning of paragraph 2 where it states, \"It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation.\" From this expression by Aristotle, we can sense the urgence of pity and fear to the makeup of a tragedy and from which, in line, feeds into the different objectives of a tragedy and what makes a tragedy ideal to Greek playwrights. Last, but not least, the third element of an ideal tragedy mentioned is to have a tragedy that is of a single reference and reasoning from which is the result of misassumed and misfortunate actions rather than of actual bad influence and illicit actions, as seen within paragraph 3 where it states, \"A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double...[i]t should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty.\"","3862":" An ideal tradgedy should have a complex plot, and should have a change in fortune from good to bad. The change should come from a great error or mistake. It should incite great emotion  or fear.","3863":"In Aristotle's ideal tragedy, the emotions pity and fear must be created in the reader. To do this, it must first have a complex plot, not a simple, easily constructed one. This plot must contain a change of fate, which causes the main character's outcome to transition from good to bad. Finally, a true tragedy must have a neutral main character, who's misfortune or ill judgement leads to their downfall. ","3864":" The factory would cover up the spoiled meat in various ways. One of the ways they would cover it up was to cover up the smell with soda and chemistry things. This would hide that the meat was bad unles someone was testing the meat. The narrator says, \"Jonas had told them how the meat that was taken out of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters; also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose.\" (Sinclair 2). The factory would also remove the parts of the meat that were visably bad. They would cut it out and cut it a different way. The factory started making boneless hams, skinned hams, california hams, and many different cuts of meat.  Lastly,  the factory would make sausage out of all of the lefftovers. They would grind up the meat into small pieces and no one could tell what was really in them.  In conclusion, the factory had many ways to use or cover up the spolied meat. ","3865":"One element of an ideal tragedy as described by Aristotle is that the tragic hero should be somewhere in between a great person and a horrible person whose downfall is a result of an error in judgement. This will be effective in creating feelings of pity and fear for the reader which are two important moods that should result from a tragedy. Another element of an ideal tragedy that Aristotle described is that the tragic hero should be someone well-known and successful. Aristotle uses the examples of Oedipus and Thyestes because both are of royal descent, helping to once again get across the feeling of fear by showing the reader that someone so fortunate may not always be so lucky. Finally, a feature that Aristotle mentioned that should be included in order to create an ideal tragedy would be that the character\u2019s fortune should go from good to bad as opposed to it going from bad to good. This reverse in fortune would create a feeling of pity for the character as the reader would feel sorry for them as they face their downfall.

","3868":"A tragedy follows the downfall of a relatable person who is not  completely good or evil, the downfall is started because of a mistake that compunds upon itself, the story is confined to a single path, and the ending is not satisfying or virtuous.","3869":"The factory would use a variety of ways to cover up the spoiled meat. First, when the meat came out of pickle it would be sour so they would rub it with soda to get rid of the smell to be able to sell it. They would also perform any \"miracle\" of chemistry, \"giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose\" (Sinclair p 2). To save time and increase their capacity, they used a machine that would be able to pickle a ham in a few seconds, but would sometimes leave the hams spoiled with a disgusting odor. To solve this issue, the packers used a stronger pickle. After smoking the hams, some would be found to have gone bad but were still sold to the public as \"Number Three Grade\". To solve this problem, they decided to extract the bone and insert a white-hot iron, getting rid of all but Number One Grade. To be able to keep selling to the general public, the packers made up numerous schemes and \"they had what they called 'boneless hams,' which were all the odds and ends of pork stuffed into casings; and 'California hams,' which were the shoulders, with big knuckle joints, and nearly all the meat cut out; and fancy 'skinned hams,' which were made of the oldest hogs, whose skins were so heavy and coarse that no  one would buy them--that is, until they had been cooked and chopped fine and labeled 'head cheese!'\" (Sinclair p 2). When the whole ham was spoiled, it went to another department where they would mix it with half a ton of other meat, even if the other meat was moldy and white, and then it would be dosed with borax and glycerin. ","3870":"The Third Wave developed fast due to students initiating other students. The  movement was terminated due to it being so outstanding , jones felt like it was getting oout of control.","3871":" How the Third Wave developled over such a short period of time was because since none of the students thought to have a different opinion or stand out, everyone kept following Jones. The students followed what everyone else was doing and when Jones started making students initiate new members, the number of participants grew due to nobody voicing what they personally wanted. In paragraph 3, the text states, \" Jones instructed the students on how to initiate new members, and by the end of the day the movement had over 200 participants.\" This evidence shows how Jones knew that the students would listen and start recruiting others and how they were all following everything Jones said because they feared standing out. The experiment ended because Jones realized that  \"... it was slipping out of control.\" This is stated in paragraph 4 and shows how Jone's point was proven, and the students witnessed how people will follow crowds even when horirble things are happening.","3872":"He says, \"A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan.\" This means that there is so much to a perfect tragedy that it is near impossible to have a perfect tragedy. \"It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity: for this moves meither pity nor fear; it merely shocks us.\" This is explaining what a perfect tragedy would consist of. \"Nor again, that of a bad man passing from adversity to prosperity: for nothing can be more alien to the spirit of Tragedy; it possesses no single tragic quality; it neither satisfies the moral sense nor calls forth pity or fear.\" This is explaining how not everything tragic is predictable.

In the passage it also states that \"... meat stored in great piles in rooms; and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of rats would race about on it....call upon their chemistry department, and preserve it with borax and color it with gelatin to make it brown.\" This explains that the employeees and employers didnt care about the products they were selling nor putting into their bodies.

They only cared about profit and not humanity.","3893":"\"After only three days, the experiment took on a life of its own\" this shows that the Third Wave was developed over a short period of time. The reasoning for this is because students from all over thr school were joining in. There was drastic improvment and in the students acedmic skills and tremendous motivation. it continued to grow over the week with more than 200 participants. They students were  more involved in the project and their disciplone and loyalty to the project was so outstanding that jones felt that it was getting out of coontrol.

You would think that something bad will happen, but in the end they turn out friends.","3895":"The workers used a process known as \"giving them thirty per cent.\" where they pumped pickle into the meats with a needle to get rid of the awful stench of the spolied meat. The passage says, \"some of them with an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them\". This shows that they had to go to exstensive levels to make the meat just good enough to pass as good meat.  Rubbing the meat in soda was also used to take away the smell.","3896":"The three elements of an ideal tragedy should involve a complex plan, awaken feelings of pity and fear, and should center around a man who is not good nor evil, but whose misfortune is brought about by a mistake.

Not only would the workers allow inedible ham to be put onto shelves, they would also allow \"meat that had tumbled out on the floor\" to \"go into the hoppers together\" (para 4) with rat dung, and poisoned bread.

As Aristotle says, \"A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan.\" Next, the character of a tragedy undergoes both pain and pity and is not ultimately good nor bad. Specifically, he describes, \"There remains, then, the character between these two extremes - that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty.\" Lastly, the diction of the tragedy is the vocabulary that is used throughout. This accounts for the tone and mood of the entire story.","3922":"There are various ways the factory would use spoiled meat. One way they would use spoiled meat is putting it in sausages. \"whenever meat as so spoiled that it could not be used for anything else, either to can it or else to chop it into sausage\" (paragraph 1).

The misfortune must be brought from a self error of judgement, and must be someone that loved and be of wealth. Lastly, the change in fortune must from good to bad, not the other way around.","3924":"At least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle are having characters that the audience can relate to, a well constructed plot brought about by an error, and they follow a true tragic ending. When discussing a tragic character, Aristolte states that it is important to have a character that the audience can relate to. He does this when he says \"There remains, then, the character between these two extremes \u2014 that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous \u2014 a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such families.\" He states that it is important to have a character with these traits because it arouses fear and pity in the audience. He states this throughout paragraph two when he says \"It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation.\" In paragraph three, Aristotle begins to discuss the importance of plot. Aristotle states that the plot of a play should not be simple but not overly complex. He states this when he says \"A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain.\" He then goes on to say that throughout the plot, the change of fortune should go from good to bad. In the last paragraph, Aristotle discusses true tragic endings and how some well know plays are mistaken for tragedies. Aristotle states that a second rank tragedy has a complex plot. He states this in the quote \"In the second rank comes the kind of tragedy which some place first. \" He then moves on to say that these types of tragedies do not have true tragic ends. Aristotle states that a second rank tragedy \"is proper rather to Comedy\" and ends with \"those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies....quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain.\" This takes away from a true tragedy because in the end, the protagonist must face their downfall. ","3925":"What they would do with the spoiled meat is like what they did to  the ham it was spoiled and they mixed tons of other different meats into the ham.","3926":"The first element of an ideal tragedy as described by Aristotle, is that it must have complexity to it. He states that a tragedy can not be simple. Another element is described as the actions contained in the tragedy should be those that make people feel pity and fear. Addtionally, Aristotle noted that the plot should only have a singular focus meaning that it should have a clear narrative. Lastly, the change in fortune in a tragedy must be from good to bad, but not because of the character's being evil, but rather from a weakness in morals.","3927":"According to Aristotle the character should be an avrage guy who has a bad life because of a mistake he made. That it shuld have one main issues not many and  that it should not have a happy ending. Finally they try to please the aduience too much and then they make a comedic ending rather than a tragic ending.","3928":"Aristotle described a tragic hero as a character who is not a good person but whose problem is brought about by a mistake they made. Similarly,  Aristotle said that a well-constructed plot has a single problem and that the change of fortune of the character goes from good to bad and not the other way around. Finally, Aristotle says that the ending of the plot should result in the death or killing of one of the main characters.","3929":"Employees that work in unsanitary factories would cover up spoiled meat in cans or chopped into sausage. People would use chemicals to hide the odor, or the taste of it. According to the passage, ''...and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smeell, and sell it to be eaten on free- lunch counters...''

According to the text, it states, \"There would be meat that had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and sawdust, where the workers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption germs.\" The meat was also in a space where rats were present, causing rats to run across the meats. As a result of rats running around, they poison them. After poisoning the rats, the rats would go in the hopper with the meat while they are processing. Workers call the poisoned rat a tidbit, and they did not care to remove the rat from the meat. This was extremely unsanitary and cruel. According to the text, it states, \"There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms, and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of rats would race about on it.\" Workers were also capable of changing the meat into; however, they wanted them, such as turning the meat brown or making the meat \"unspoil.\" They would use chemistry and machines to change spoiled meat. If it were so difficult to get these meats to change, they would sell it as a number three grade meat.

Formerly these had been sold as \"Number Three Grade,\" but later on, some ingenious person had hit upon a new device, and now they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron.\" The workers also rubbed meat in soda to get meat to go from sour to sweet and change the bad odor.

A second rule states that the main character must not be a completely good or evil man, but a man who has a few small flaws that lead to disaster. Another very important rule is that the events of the play must progress from good to bad, and it must end terribly for the main character so that those emotions mentioned in rule one are felt clearly.

","4011":"Three elements of an ideal tragedy as described by Aristotle are a well constructed plot, a character's soul, as well as the production\/performance. The most important element of an ideal tragedy is based off of the plot. Aristotle says that, \" The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad,\" (Aristotle, 3). The outcome of the main character will have come from some sort of great error or frailty, the ideal tragic hero should be an all good man with a very minor flaw in his character, and the entire tragedy should be continued upon this judgement. Aristotle also explains how a the plot should be a very complex plan where the actions of the characters exemplify emotions such as pity and fear with the distinctive mark of tragic imitation. He suggests that the best sorts of a tragedy are the complex plots that arouse both pity and fear. He then explains how a good plot must avoid a hero becomming miserable, avoid the transition from misery to happiness for an the antagonist, and also avoid the antagonist to feel happiness and leading into one's misery. He simply just believes that the best plot derives from the mistrtune of someone and whose future downfall leads to an error in judgement. The second element includes the character's actions and personality. To Aristotle, the character must be set up for failure even though this character has the personality of a \"good character.\" The show , \"follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity: for this moves neither pity nor fear; it merely shocks us. Nor, again, that of a bad man passing from adversity to prosperity: for nothing can be more alien to the spirit of Tragedy; it possesses no single tragic quality; it neither satisfies the moral sense nor calls forth pity or fear,\" (Aristotle, 2).  Meaning this, the overall sense and focus of the play should not be based on the hero losing his \"good.\" Instead, the character must make multiple judgements and go through an entire storyline, not aware of the downfall set right for him. The final element of an ideal tragedy is the spectacle and production itself. Although Aristotle does not go fully into the details regarding this element, in paragraph 3, it is noted that \" A tragedy, then, to be perfect according to the rules of art, should be of this construction....because he follows this principle in his plays, many of which end unhappily. It is, as we have said, the right ending. The best proof is that on the stage and in dramatic competition, such plays, if well worked out, are the most tragic in effect\" (Aristotle, 3). Rather than explaining the scenic visuals of the play and visual effects of a \"spectacle,\" Aristotle explains that the true spectacle is the dramatic competition and the tragedy in effect. The best endings is one that is unhappy and shocks the audience. ","4012":"The ancient Egyptian system of government was assembled like a pyramid, for example, the gods were at the top. In paragraph 1 it states \"Egyptians believed that the gods controlled the universe. On the top of our government, we have our president. Up next to the pharaohs, in Egypt, they thought the pharaohs were gods and commanded the army.

They threw any spoiled meats in with the fres meats and locked it in a dark room where rats would run around in the pile. Workers couldn't see well so they just threw all of the dead rats in with the sausage meat. some of the meat \"had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and sawdust, where the workers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption germs\" They had no sinks so they would also wash their hands in the water that was mixed into the meat along with many other unsanitary things.","4014":"In this reading it states that workers would use pickes to hide the scent of spouled meat.

Nobles had great status and grew very wealthy from the donations to the gods (Noble Aims Section). Soldiers fought in wars or put an end to domestic uprisings. They also supervised the peasants, farmers, and slaves who were involved with building structures like pyramids and palaces during long periods of time. Physicians and craftsmen and woman made up the middle class. Craftsmen made and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, tools, and much more. Merchants and storekeepers would sell these goods to the people (Soldier On Section). Now on the bottom of the social pyramid (or social structure as it is called in the article), slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war. They were forced to work on building projects. They also worked extremely hard at the discretion of the pharoh or nobles. Wanting to change your social status was impossible to do. A very tiny number of peasants and farmers did go up in the economic ladder. Schools were ran by priests and artisans.

Aristotle overall scopes the plot of perfect tragedy by revealing that the  character must be one of prestige. In his efforts to indicate this claim, he incorporates the examples of  Oediupus and Thyestes. In doing this, Aristotle indicates that one of the key features of an ideal tragedy involves an individual that is highly prosperous in order to drive his plot even further. The second element expressed is the trait within a character that allows for a downfall. Aristotle also used Oedipus, Orestes, and other tragic heroes from mythology in order to heavily emphasize that the flaw in the personality. Aristotle mentions that this error in one's character should be due to misjudgment or frailty. Evidently, all these elements influence the overall idea he expressed that to a perfect tragedy an individual must experience a downfall or a reversal of misfortune. He uses the previous two elements in order to enhance this idea by affirming that from being a prosperous individual, the character's flaws will allow him to plunder into a downfall and lose the  fortune they possess.","4056":"A perfect tragedy should have actions that exercise the feeling of being pity for a person but also to fear what their plan is next.

This included suppressing the odor through the use of borax and glycerin, adding more meat to cover the spoiled meat, filling hams with pickle, chopping spoiled meat to make \"sausage\", selling bad hams as \"Number Three Grade\", and through extracting the bone of bad ham and selling it as boneless ham. Since spoiled meat had a very strong odor to it, workers within factories had to ensure that consumers would not be able to smell it so that they would be more likely to buy and consume it. As a result, they used sweet smelling or odorless products in order to mask the stench. Hams were pickled with a machine that was both quick and effective, but would sometimes spoil the meat further. This detail further helped to support Sinclair's claim that factories mainly cared about making a profit rather than the health of their consumers. Additionally, factory workers used methods of hiding or covering up spoiled meat by making it more subtle through covering it with unspoiled meat or chopping it into smaller pieaces so it would go unnoticed by consumers. Lastly, Sinclair describes how spoiled ham was especially covered up through selling bad ham as \"Number Three Grade\" or \"smoked ham\". Later however, \"they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron\" (Sinclair 1906).

Also, the tragedy should arise from a mistake or error from the main character. The tragedy should, \"come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse.\" (Paragraph 3) Lastly, the ideal tragedy shifts the mood from good to bad, most often ending the same way.

The factories had no health regulations, the meat was stored in places infested with germs. The factories knew how filthy their facility was and had put no effort in  to change it. In paragraph 4 it states, \u201cThere would be meat that had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and sawdust, where the workers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption germs.\u201d(4).

Workers knew that what they were doing was wrong and never second guessed it, \u201ca man could run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of the dried dung of rats. These rats were nuisances, and the packers would put poisoned bread out for them; they would die, and then rats, bread, and meat would go into the hoppers together.\u201d(4).

Instead, a tragedy should contain a character who is not famously good and whose misfortune is brought about by a judgment error or weakness.  Another element is that the plot should be single in its issues rather than double. Also, the change in fortune should not be from bad to good but reverse from good to bad.

This is when a main charcter finally overcomes their obsticles and gets to celebrate. The last element is wrong judgement, this is the reason for the main charcter's tragedy.

He made the students attend a rally where he announced that this was an experiment to show how people willingly follow the crowd or create a sense of superitory over others leading to horrible things.

This happens in real life and only takes a short amount of time since so many people are following one thing or idea and it spreads rapidly. The experiment ended because Jones realized first of all that if the experiment went on any longer it would lead to an authoritarian school and result in something much more than a experiment if it went on. He also noticed that it worked out too perfectly probably and that it was time to go ahead and end the experiment since it was a success already.

There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms; and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of rats would race about on it. It was too dark in these storage places to see well, but a man could run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of the dried dung of rats.

Second, Aristotle asserts that the character's life must go from good to bad, instead of bad to good. There must be a decline in the character's fate that culminates in a disaster that doesn't end well for him.

Aristotle believes that the character of a tragedy should not be a villain and nor should it be a hero as this creates fundamental flaws within the emotions of the reader which brings me to the second element of an ideal tragedy.  The second element of an ideal tragedy is that the emotions and experiences had by the character must appear relatable to the reader as these are the precise emotions that a tragedy aims to make the reader feel.  By allowing the reader to actually feel tragedy they are left with the emotions of a tragic conclusion which brings me to the final aspect of an ideal tragedy.  The final element of a proper tragedy is that the conclusion must remain tragic; meaning that the character must not see his conditions reverse.  By allowing the character to remain in tragedy even through the end of the story the author allows the reader to bask in the emotions that are ever-present in a successful tragedy.","4670":"The experiment was ended because the nazis ended after the war.

It states,\" After only three days, the experiment took on a life of its own, with students from all over the school joining in.\" This statement is simply saying that the experiment started to take a route that no one really expected, especially Jones. Students from all over started to tell Jones on other members that failed to abide by the rules and the loyalty was outstanding. With this being said, Jones felt it was getting out of control so he decided to terminate the movement. It states in pargraph 4,\" By the fourth day of the experiment, the students became increasingly involved in the project and their discipline and loyalty to the project was so outstanding that Jones felt it was slipping out of control.\" The statement explains why Jones felt he had to end the experiment.

In paragraph 11 it states, \"At the bottom of the social structure were slaves and farmers. Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war.

Second, the Character should not be a bad man but neither a good man who has fallen into misfortune, since this envokes pity which alludes to a simple plot.

Moreover, the main storyline of a good tragedy should provoke pity and fear.  Thus, the plot should invoke a change of good to bad, due to a flaw or frailty in the main character rather than some deliberately immoral behavior. Also, the main character of a tragedy  must be highly renowned and illustrious, for this will invoke pity and fear in  a tragic situation.","4925":"The Third Wave developed over such a short period of time because many students listened to whatever Jones said and even told him that other students were slacking off and such.

A character mustn't be overly good or bad and the tragedy must be brought from a flaw of the character with the character being famous and happy.  A tragedy's plot must be good, it shouldn't be too confusing or too perdictable. The ending should be based off the audience's emotions. Using what the audience feels to write an ending that meets the expectations of the audience is key to making a good tragedy.","4931":"An ideal tragedy should imitate actions that excite pity and fear.

Having one problem in a tragedy helps the audience focus on that one problem, and having to many of those can cause the audience to get side tracked easily or get lost on what is happening. A second element that aristotle thinks is important is that the story line should have the actor go from good to bad, and not bad to good. This can help the audience stay involved and not get bored through the story, and it also gives the audience to think aboutor be curious about while they are reading it. The third ans last strategy that Aristotle brings up is that \"It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frality, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse.\" This means that the character shouldn't exactly be a villan or act evil, but be  make many mistakes and have moral weakness.","4933":"There would be hams found spoiled, some of them with an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them.

The plot is required to progress from beginning to end in an organized fashion of anticipated events. The end of the tragedy is responsible for tying up any loose ends. Character is the second most essential element of an ideal tragedy. The hero must begin the tragedy by embracing feelings of happiness. As the tragedy progresses, there must be a shift from happiness to misery, \"The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad.\" The hero should be painted in a good way. In addition, the plot must always demand that of a tragic action which can be addressed with innocence or absolute awareness.

The industry covered the smell by using cola or soda. \"how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters;\"(paragraph 2). The meat industry used soda to mask the smell and sold the meat on open counters causing more disease. Soda could have worn off and the company could have possibly be sued. The industry could have also used pickle juice or some other type of smell. \"To pump into these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle which destroyed the odor,\" ( paragraph 2).

At the top were the gods, such as Ra, Osiris, and also Isis. The egyptians believed that all the gods controlled the universe, therefore it was very important to keep them happy. Egyptians also elevated some of the human biengs to gods. The pharoahs, their ledaers were also believed to be gods but in human form. Also right below the were powerful nobes and priests who where responsible for plasing the gods. Next were the  peasents, then the slaves and then there was the farmers who handled crops.

By this, he means that a tragedy should make the audience feel a lot of different emotions but mostly pity and fear. They should pity the main character but also fear them because they will eventually become bad. Another element he highlights is a lapse in judgment, he writes, \"\u2014 that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity,5 but by some error of judgment or frailty.\". One man cannot be good nor bad but simply make a mistake. A good tragedy is when the man is just a normal person who takes the wrong turn or makes a deadly mistake that results in a series of alarming events. The final element he discusses is an unhappy ending.  Aristotle explains, \"many of which end unhappily. It is, as we have said, the right ending.\". Tragedies should end unhappily. The essence of a tragedy is not to get a happy ending or to have everything resolved it is just simply to end. They are very realistic pieces of literature and having a happy ending would only ruin the emotions set out throughout the entire play.","5120":"The kids were intrigued in the difference of teaching and discipline that their teacher were showing.

He drills these into their heads and along with discipline. Next, he gives a simple yet catchy motto and a symbol such as a salute. Soon the students were shown how to initiate new members. The number rapidly grew from 30 to 43 to finally 200 members. Jones felt the experiment slipping away so he decided to end it.

The vizier ensured that taxes were collected.\" Also the text says that,\"Working with the vizier were scribes who kept government records.

For instance, even the rats that ran across the meat were not spared as \"there were things that went into the sausage in comparison with which a poisoned rat was a tidbit.\" This example greatly exemplified the magnitude of unsanitary items that were mixed in with the meat. Also, he employs strong diction to describe how the \"moldy and white\" sausage from Europe was used in conjunction with \"borax and glycerin\" to mask its odor, taste, and color. This again demonstrates the abysmal standards used in the meat-packing industry at the time, and further shows how the workers went to great lengths to sell the spoiled meat.","5139":"The structure of the ancient Egyptian system of government was that Egyptian society was structured like a pyramid.

They had absolute power over their subjects. After pharaohs died, huge stone pyramids were built as their tombs. Pharaohs were buried in chambers within the pyramids.

For example, in the text it states, \"A small number of peasants and farmers moved up the economic ladder.\" (paragraph 13) This supports my claim because it shows that some members of the lower class could advance to higher ranks.

Being scaed and having fear inside themself or yourself is good and bad you are ready for any tragedy that comes your way becasue you think about it.

Relating to the character can help the readers feel more understandable of the incident that the character goes through, and because the character has to be relatable to the audience, the audience will see a little part of themselves in the character, which makes them feel pity. A third element of an ideal tragedy is that a tragedy should not resemble a comedy. A tragedy has to be serious, in order for the audience to feel fear, pity, and slight sympathy towards a character. Comedic feelings would cancel out the feelings of fear and pity which would harm the true meaning of a tragedy.

The fortune of the plot however should go from good to bad, resulting from an error or frailty, from a character or some other element placed within the tale.

Aristotle explains that to achieve satisfying the moral sense and invoking fear\/pity in the audience, the play writer must have the main character be \"...a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty.\" He also explains that because that must be the main character, the plot must be \"single in it's issue, rather than double as some maintain.\" These 3 elements are the basis of a good tragedy, and need to have them in order to succeed.","5281":"This experiment developed by students telling otherr studetns to join in.

More students then started to join this group, as more people became more successful and part of the group. They were taught how to initiate new members and they were all given tasks and jobs. At the end of the day Jones had over 200 participants. The experiment was ended by Jones when he realized this was getting out of hand, and he was losing too much control. He tricked the students by telling them that there was a presidential candidate that would represent this nationwide movement, and announce it over television. They were shown a blank channel, then they were told about the experiment and what it was about.","5288":"The third wave happened in April of 1967 at the Cubberley High School. Mr. Jones wanted to show students how easily they could get caught up in it. The first thing he did was teach them how to seat and strict classroom discipline.

They were all had member cards and they each had their own assignment. On day four they became really into their assignment and they had become really loyal.

The teacher created a movement which he encouraged for the students to join. The movement's purpose was to eliminate democracy, and one of the central points that Jones provided was that, \" democracy's main weakness is that it favors the individual over the whole community\" ( The Third Wave 1).  Moreover, he encouraged them even more to join by creating a catchy motto that read, \"Strength through discipline, stregth through community, strength throught action, strength through pride\" ( The Third Wave 1). When the students joined the movement, not only they followed every single rule put by Jones, rules such as calling him Mr.Jones for every remark they wanted to make. They had to be sitted and oaying attention before the second bell, had to stand up every time one asked a question with three words or fewer. These were strict rules, rules that they were not used to. Yet, they followed them.

This single plot should follow an arc from good fortune to bad fortune rather than the other way around. Another element of an ideal tragedy is that it should cause feelings of pity or fear; pity at the sight of undeserved misfortune and fear at the downfall of a character in which the audience sees themselves. A final aspect of an ideal tragedy is that the main character should not be wholly good but whose downfall isn't caused by his own evil but rather by a bad choice or a simple oversight.

For example this,\"Their leaders, called pharaohs, were believed to be gods in human form. \" The pharaoh is the leader, he takes control of everything, and gives out roles and assignments that need to be done.

As the movement gained popularity the new motivated students became a sort of court not letting any nonmembers into the classroom and eventually got over 200 participants. The main reasoning for terminating the movement was because students became too invested into the experiment and Jones felt it was slipping out of his control to get rid of the experiment he lied to the students by announcing that the third wave was a part of a national wave movement and Jones ordered students to attend a publicly announced presidential candidate of the movement, when the day came they were presented with a blank channel and Jones saw that as an opportunity to announce that they were a part of an experiment to demonstrate how people willingly create a sense of superiority over others even when horrible things are happening.","5367":"In the structure of the ancient Egyptian system, the bottom is the slaves, the second is farmers and farmers pay 60% what of they grow, 3rd is merchants, merchants sell goods to people, 4th is soldiers,  last of all is pharaohs, pharaohs are godlike to everyone.

Furthermore, the narrative the writer is trying to tell his audience should always end in leaving the readers and the character(s) unhappy. In relation to this element, the second main ingredient to create an ideal tragedy is to incite emotion from the readers, more specifically, pity and fear. Aristotle believes that the readers should not only see the pity and fear that the character is going through, but they should also feel it in an intense manner. Lastly, the third main element to creating an ideal tragedy according to Aristotle is to have a relatable and good character make a reasonable mistake. What Aristotle means from this is to have a character of goodness be brought down by a mistake that anyone could have made but is created to be blown out of proportion.

Character was the two extremes or the tragic hero. in the story it says the character between these two extremes \u2014 that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty.

These people were in the middle, which meant they do have an important role in Ancient Egypt. But there are not much idolized like the pharaohs. These types of people worked hard also because craftsmen and soliders always had to work for the pharaohs will. Craftsmen also had to make goods for anybody in Acient Egypt, and thats a lot to keep up with. But for soldiers they always had to protect Ancient Egypt and the pharaohs most of all. Now all the way at the bottom we have slaves, and the farmers. For them it wasway harder to live life then any other person. They would always have high taxes, make sure they did everything for the pharaohs, and also they were against their will for anything. All of these structures how they worked as a government together was very surprising also because they had a great civilization for many years.

Early on, Aristotle establishes that the main point of a tragedy is to make the audience feel fear and pity, which requires a certain main character. This character must not be perfect or sinister. That would lead to the audience feeling little pity or fear. The audience would not be able to properly sympathize with this character due to most being somewhere in the middle of those extremes. Additionally, both the plot and ending to a tradegy must show a steep downward spiral regarding this character's life preferably due to human error. That way ,the audience will feel both pity and fear knowing they could have acted similarly. Anything else will not evoke the proper emotions.

It can do this by making the protagonist prosper, but then losing it all. Their loss isn't caused utterly, but rather due to an error. Secondly, a tragedy should also be single in its issue of the plot. It cannot be a character climbing, it can only be their downfall. It can do this by the main character doing something or suffering from something terrible. Finally, a tragedy should ideally also have a double threaded plot with an opposite catastrophe going on at the same time. Comedy can help make this a possibility.","5517":"The Egyptian government  had many diffrent areas tht were completely diffrent for example the pharoh was like thier king and the soilders they would just protect they would even get to chose shat they even eat if they were luck the soldiers would have bread that was not that stel so there was a big diffrence bettwen but when there is poor in rich there are peole in the middle and those people were the nobles and the preist they were high above they had some poer but not that much the preist would have many diffrent choices for food and he would be able to talk to the other gods and pray and chant diffrent things his job was to please the gods.

However, due to how quickly the group grew, Jones realized that the experiment was going to fall out of control and thusly \"pulled the plug.\" The main reason for this is likely that if the experiment had continued, students within the Third Wave would spark conflict with those who were not and further demonstrate how feelings of superiority lead to bad outcomes.","5541":"The classes were like a pyramid, gods at top, nobles and priest in the middle, and farmers, slaves, servents, and peasants at the bottom.

And the priest worshipped gods so they would not get angry. Then came the soldiers. What the soldiers did, they fought in wars but in peace time, they managed the peasants and slaves.

Aristotle claims that a plot should also not be too complex, and go from good to bad rather than bad to good.","5640":"The factory would use many tactics to try to cover up or use spoilt meat.

Aristotle  believes that the goal of a tragedy is to \"imitate actions which excite pity and fear\" and argues that in order for the tragedy to accomplish this goal, it should feature the downfall of a hero \"who is neiter eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought on not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty.\" He thinks that if the hero were purely good, his downfall would simply be shocking to the audience, whereas the downfall of a purely evil man would not arouse pity or fear, since \"pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves\" and the audience would instead derive moral satisfaction from seeing the evil man get what he deserved. Finally, Aristotle writes that while a tragedy should \"be arranged not only the simple but on the complex plan\" but that there should not be a \"double thread of plot, and also an opposite catastrophe for the good and bad\" because in that case the sense of pleasure from the audience will not be \"true tragic pleasure\" but closer to what the audience would feel when watching a comedy.","5642":"    One way that the industry would hide their rotten meat is by being dosed with borax glyserin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for consumtion.

One piece of evidence that shows this is \"Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions they profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh\" (Paragraph 6).

The next class down are the Merchants and Craftspeople. These people live comfterbly but are not wealthy. The text states, \"Craftsmen made and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, tools, and other useful things.\" (9). The final class are the farmers and slaves. The slaves are people who got captured during war and had to do things many other people wanted to do, like make the pyramids and give their crops to the pharaoh.

A true tragedy should also have a more complex plot as opposed to a simple one because then it can shock the viewers and also, once again, excite pity and fear. The last element of an ideal tragedy would be that it should be not from adversity to prosperity, but prosperity to adversity.

","5669":"For starters, as the text states \" At the bottom of the social structure were slaves and farmers.\" . Slaves got captured as prisioners of war and they would be forced to work on building projects. While as the text states \"Farmers tended to the fields, raised animals, kept canals and reservoirs in good order, worked in the stone quarries, and built the royal monuments. Some connections the farmers had to the government was that they had to pay taxes, slaves had a connection to pharaohs or nobles because they were basically working on everything for them. Then theres the skilled workersand they are mostly physicians and craftsmen, they made up the middle class. As the text states \"Craftsmen made and sold jewlery, pottery, papyrus, products, tools, and other useful things.\" so they made up the middle class and they had an comfortable life. Then there are soldiers, and as the text states \" During long periods of peace, soldiers also supervised the peasants, famers, and slaves who were involved in building such structures as pyramids and palaces.\" , ther soldiers also went to war. Now higher up are the nobles and priests. As the text states \" Only the nobles could hold government posts; in these positions they profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods.\" and they are right before the pharaohs on the social structure.

Firstly, in paragraph 2, Aristotle writes \"A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan.\" This statement shows how an ideal tragedy should have a complex plot to show how the character changes throughout the tragedy as he falls from where he used to stand. Second, he states in paragraph 3, \"Now, the best tragedies are founded on the story of a few houses - on the fortunes of Alcmaeon, Oedipus, Orestes, Meleager, Thyestes, Telephus, and those others who have done or suffered something terrible.\" This quote shows how the best tragedies focus on characters who were greatly affected by the tragedy, which makes it have a great plot.

In paragraph two Aristotle states, \"...a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity...\" The third element is having actions \"which excite pity and fear.\" Aristotle explains that we should avoid three types of plots which do not excite pity and fear.

In the text it states,\"Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. \" This shows that nobles and priests were also very powerful.

In conclution, There are not lots of people at the top of the Pyrimid and at the lower part of the Pyrimid there are alot more people.","5924":"As Aristotle states, there are many key elements to a tragedy. Aristotle claims that without these key elements, the work can not be considered a tragedy. These elements shape how the plot should look, and what the characters should act like. The first of these elements is a complex plan that arouses both pity and fear. Another key element that relates to this, is how the story should not be morally satisfying. This would make the story irregular and make it even more \"sad\" for a reader. Characters also need to be specific to produce a good tragedy, the main character must start in a high, well regarded position and take a massive fall into a more depressing state.

A complex plot is also involved in an idealogical tragedy. Tragedies aim to be \"single in tissue, rather than double as maintain.\" The plot should also not follow a storyline that goes from bad to good, but actually good to bad.  Lastly, character is another important aspect. Character is usually one that is considered to be a person who is good, but suffers misfortune and even their downfall due to their own judgement, making them very relatable. Usually they are also famous and prosperous, as seen with Oedipus and Thyestes. Therefore, pity and fear, complex plots, and character are all crucial to an idealogical tragedy.","5931":"The Third Wave developed over such a short period of time because Jones told his students it was an experiment.

First, Aristotle explains that \"a perfect tragedy should be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan\". (Aristotle 2). Aristotle continues by suggesting that the tragedy should \"imitate actions which excite pity and fear\" and calls this the \"distinctive mark of tragic imitation\" (Aristotle 2). This desire for readers to feel pitiful and fearful leads to Aristotle's second element of an ideal tragedy; for it to be emotional. Aristotle claims that an emotional piece \"is proper rather to Comedy,\" suggesting that all tragedies should end with the reader feeling sorrow. (Aristotle 4). Lastly, the author states that the ideal tragedy \"should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad\" (Aristotle 3). Aristotle believes that the ideal tragedy should include \"that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgment or frailty\" (Aristotle 3).","5949":"In the text it talk about how to factory would cover up the smell of rotten meat.

The audience is moved by this abrupt change of fortune as it creates a sense of pity and concern for the characters. He also assumed that the character would endure a fall due to their own error of judgement in an ideal tragedy. As it should be \"brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty.\" By this approach, the text represented it as being able to alter the audience's perception of the personality and behavior of the character.

These people sold goods and other products to the public. Finally, at the lowest level on the social pyramid, were slaves and farmers. As the article states, \"Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war.\" Slaves were forced to work on building projects and other difficult tasks that only people on the lowest level of the social class pyramid would do. The article says \"Farmers tended fields, raised animals, kept canals and reservoirs in good order, worked in the stone quarries and built the royal monuments.\" Farmers also paid taxes that could equal as much as 60% of their yearly harvest. The article also explains how social mobility was possible. Men could learn to become scribes and work their way up the social pyramid.

The tragedy shoud evoke a sense of pity as well as fear onto the audience over a character who does not move from prosperity to adversity (it is just shocking, not pitiful or fearful) or a character that does not face misfortune when they do not deserve it. Additonally, the swap of fortune should be from good to bad rather than bad to good, resulting in an unhappy ending. This, according to Aristotle, hightens the dramatic reaction to the tragedy. Lastly, Aristotle claims the perfect tragedy should be proper instead of comedic, should have conflict such as relationship changes and characters who are slain, and it should have plot in which is \"double-threaded\". In simpler terms, Aristotle believes the ideal tragedy is complex, has a change in plot from good to bad, and should make the audience feel pity and fear towards the actions against the main character.","5999":"3 different ideal elements of tragedy as described throughout can be seen throughout the text.

The economical positions rise as they go up. At the very top point of the pyramid are the gods. Here is the order from greatest to least: Egyptian Gods\/Pharaohs,  nobles\/priests, soldiers, craftmen\/traders, and lastly farmers\/slaves. The gods are at the highest position in status. They have the right to overpower everyone. Also, since everyone praises them they believe that the gods were responsible of many things as well. Like safety. Sometimes the pharaohs direct the army or create laws. As stated in the text, \"They had absolute power over their subjects...The pharaoh directed the army in case of a foreign threat or an internal conflict. All the laws were enacted at the discretion of the pharaoh.\" Because the pharaohs\/gods couldn't do all the duties themselves they have assistants called viziers which are chief ministers. They have the duty of collecting taxes from people like farmers. According to the article, \"No single person could manage all these duties without assistance. The pharaoh appointed a chief minister called a vizier as a supervisor. The vizier ensured that taxes were collected.\" Called a \"chain of command\" the viziers have assistants as well.  They are called scribes; they are the only ones who can read and write. Now under the whole chain of gods\/pharaohs there are the nobles\/priests. According to the text, the only people who can develop government posts are the nobles. And priests' duties are to keep the gods satisfied. Like said in the text, \"Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions they profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods.\" Also, the nobles grow very wealthy from recieving all the gifts of the gods from the subjects. Next are the soldiers. The soldiers fight in wars or end \"domestic uprisings.\" Also, they sometimes keep an eye on farmers, peasants, and slaves. As said in the article, \"Soldiers fought in wars or quelled domestic uprisings. During long periods of peace, soldiers also supervised the peasants, farmers, and slaves who were involved in building such structures as pyramids and palaces.\" Next comes the middle class which is made up of skilled people life artisans, craftmen\/women, and physicians. The craftmen would create jewlery and other products and then sell them to make some money. They were known as the merchants and sorekeepers. \"Skilled workers such as physicians and craftsmen\/women made up the middle class. Craftsmen made and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, tools, and other useful things. Naturally, there were people needed to buy goods from artisans and traders. These were the merchants and storekeepers who sold these goods to the public.\" And at the bottom\/base are the farmers and slaves. The farmers has to raise animals, take care of the fields, conduct some tasks in the stone quarries, construct royal monuments, and are responsible to keep the reservoirs and canals in shape. They also have to pay 60% of their annual harvest towards tax. \"Farmers tended the fields, raised animals, kept canals and reservoirs  in good order, worked in the stone quarries, and built the royal monuments.

The experiment was ended because, \"... the students became increasingly involved in the project and their discipline and loyalty to the project was so outstanding that Jones felt it was slipping out of control.

The pharaoh directed an army  in case of a foreign threat or an internal conflict stated on paragraph 3. All laws were enacted at the discretion of the pharaoh.

This shows that the factory would use unsanitary spoiled meat and even use parts of the animal that were not edible.

Next,  soldiers supervised peasants, farmers, and slaves.  They fought wars and stopped uprisings.  Also, skilled workers such as craftsmen and doctors were the middle class.  At the bottom of the social structure were farmers and slaves.  Farmers tended the fields, raised animals,  kept reservoirs in good order, and worked in built the royal monuments.

Under the pharaohs, were the nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions they profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods. Nobles enjoyed great status and also grew wealthy from donations to the gods. The pharaoh appointed a chief minister called a vizier as a supervisor.

Another example would be making the downfall of the villain a big event that has no consequences. All three of this things, mainly due to their predictability, make it difficult for a viewer to invest their emotions into the tragedy.

The quote \" The Egyptians also elevated some human beings to gods. They had absolute power\" -(paragraph 4) and \" They could make the Nile overflow, cause famine, or even bring death.\" (paragraph 2) showed how important they were to the people. Next came viziers and scribes they had the next highest tax level making them some of the most important showing the levels of the pyramid. They were able to read and write. Next was nobles and priests. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods while the nobles \"enjoyed great status and grew wealthy from donations to the gods.\" (paragraph 8). The next level was the soldiers. Soldiers were a part of the lower part of the middle class,  they didn't have war often so they were not ranked that high but they weren't the lowest. Speaking of the lowest, slaves and farmers were on the lowest level of the social structure. Farmers tended the fields, raised animals, and kept their food chain in good order while slaves were servants for people in the higher classes. All of the people in the Egyptian government's social structure were involved because of their jobs. All of the people helped out and had a job making sure they were all included.","6292":"It developed so quickly because Mr Jones told the students how to recruit new members.

In the text, it states that Mr.Jones made the members of his class salute each other, even in his absence. \"Jones made up a salute resembling that of the Nazi regime and ordered class members to salute each other even outside the class. They all obeyed this command.\" The students all ended up obeying his command as stated, causing the other kids in the school to recognize that students were saluting each other. The other students became interested and wanted to join. When they learned that the students who were seen saluting each other around the halls were seeing improvements in grades, it gave them another reason to want to join the class. The class had grown by 13 students after only three days. \"The class expanded from initial 30 students to 43 attendees.\" Mr. Jones recognized this increase and then taught his students how to initiate new members, growing the numbers even more. \"Jones instructed the students on how to initiate new members, and by the end of the day, the movement had over 200 participants. \" The initiation training led to the classes immense growth over such a short period of time, as proved by the quote. By the time the fourth day had rolled around, Mr. Jones felt like he was losing control of the experiment and had to end it. \"...the students became increasingly involved in the project and their discipline and loyalty to the project was so outstanding that Jones felt it was slipping out of control. He decided to terminate the movement...\" Had Mr. Jones not lost his grip on the experiment, perhaps he would have continued it longer as it did show improvements in grades and popularity. Had Mr. Jones not terminated the project, he could have ended up creating the next Nazi Regime on accident. In conclusion, Mr. Jones successfully demonstrated how groups followed the crowd, through the commencement and termination of his experiment The Third Wave.

Sinclair expresses, \"...it would be dosed with borax and glycerinand dumped into the hoppers...\" (Sinclair para. 6). This is when Sinclair desribes what chemicals they cover the spoiled meat in. Once they cover it in chemicals, they grind it up with the other meat. The text states, \"...it would be taken up and dumped into the hoppers with fresh meat, and sent out to the public's breakfast.\" (Sinclair, para. 6). This is an illustration of what they do with the spoiled meat that had been sitting in waste barrels for a long time. This shows how they would mix it with all the other meat so no one would find out it was disgustingly old. In Conclusion, the use of chemicals and dumping rotten meat with fresh meat was how the factory covered up the rotten meat in \"The Jungle\".","6304":"Aristoteles explained that the tragedy should be able to pass feelings of \"pity and fear\" to the public, that is, it should be a highly emotional narrative. He aslo said that tragedy should aslo be an \"imitation action\", but not an imitation of human beings. This is because the tragedy should represent an action of happiness and unhappiness related to the character and the actions that people are able to perform. It must aslo \"not on the simple but on the complex plan\".","6305":"it devolped over a short period of time because it proved his point by showing how people would follow the crowd and it was shut down because it got out of hand.","6306":"To start off, the factory would use or cover up meat by injecting chemicals into the ham to take away the odor and to either skin the animal or chop out the bones, especially the bad meat surrounded by a particular bone. Plus using machines made the meat more plump and juicy.  Also they would even cook up tiny bits of skin as head of cheese. California hams were the meat that took up the animal's shoulder which were real tough. The text says, \"rub soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters.  \"Boneless hams,\u201d which were all the odds and ends of pork stuffed; and \u201cCalifornia hams,\u201d which were the shoulders and big knuckle joints.

The machines consisting of a hollow needle attached to a pump; this needle plunged  into meat and working with his foot, a man could fill a ham with pickle in a few seconds.\" This demonstrates the idea of how all employees within a factory process the meat by using these different working methods. To summarize, a few ways that helped the factory to make it more efficent was by covering up the ghastly smell, using machinery to help workers, and taking out the bad meat from the inside. Of course, there are a couple of other systems like combining other meat together to make sausages.

Another element Aristotle states an ideal tragedy should have \"that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectable of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity\"(Aristotle 10-12).

He believed that a tragedy could be about a hero or a villain. The 3rd element that Aristotle believes makes a tragedy is how the story goes from good to bad.

In the third paragraph it states, \"Jones instructed the students on how to initiate new members, and by the end of the day the movement had over 200 participants.\" The students listened to the teacher to be \"safe\" and the rest of the students join to be \"safe\" people would rather follow the group and be wrong than to take the risk of being right but standing alone.","6368":"They would rub a lot of the spoiled meat and rub them in numurous things to take away the rotten smells.

Upton Sinclair states, \"To pump into these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle which destroyed the odor- a process known to the workers as \"giving them thirty per cent.\" Then, if the meat looked moldy they had a different process. The article states, \"There would come all the way back from Europe old sausage that has been rejected, and that was moldy and white- it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption.\" This shows how the workers didnt care how old the meat was and where it came from, but instead how much they could make and money. ","6370":"According to Aristotle, one element of an ideal tragedy would be a change of fortune from good to bad. A second element of an ideal tragedy would be having a decent, well-liked character, whose misfortune happens because of a mistake. \"...that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. \" Thirdly, a good tragedy should include suffering. \"...and those others who have done or suffered something terrible. A tragedy, then, to be perfect according to the rules of art, should be of this construction.\" ","6371":"The ancient Egyptian system of government was frequently compared to their famous pyramids. Starting at the top, the gods, which were believed to have the power of controlling the universe. Below was the \"human form\" of the gods, the pharaohs. The pharaoh leads the Egyptians until death, when a pharaoh dies his subordinates honor him by building massive tombs with many jewels. Right under pharaohs are nobles and priests. The difference between the two is that nobles manage the government and priests thrive in pleasing the gods. The vizier managed the taxes, they were below the priests and nobles.  The soldiers watched over builders when they weren't fighting. They were also under vizier but still respected. Coming to the middle class we have craftsmen and physicians, they normally sold jewelry, tools, pottery, and other such things. At the bottom of the pyramid were slaves and farmers. As a result, they paid a hefty amount of taxes. Of course, this is a way to move up the pyramid but it is fairly rare. ","6372":"in paragraph 1,5,6,11 it states that the hiher level people mastered rare skills in acient Egypt and that the top were like gods cause they pretty much controlled the universe and the noble and priests paid to the pharaoh and the priest were responsible for pleasing the gods and at the bottom were slave and farmers, the slaves became fate and the farmers tended the felds and animals.","6373":"the factory would use chemicails to cover up the smell of the bad meat, they would take the hallow of the ham and put pickle in it which they would sell it as \"number 3 grade\".","6374":"The social egyption classes were a big deal. It was very important to have people do exactly what they were told to, if not, the egyptions would have to reorganize and plan lots more so they could maintane a proper way of living. \"Social mobility was not impossible. A small number of peasants and farmers moved up the economic ladder.\" This message from the texts shows that even the lowest people on the social class could move up to become part of the government. In conclusion, different social classes were all part of the government because they all had a certain place to hold their responsibilites.","6375":"The third wave helped the students realize how much of an impact a democracy could have on anything and how fast other people were drawn to it but the teacher wanted to get rid of democracy so he did all the \"bad\" things.

One of these elements include imitating actions which excite pity and fear. It says this in paragraph 2,  \"It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation\". Another element is that it should be arranged on the complex plan rather than the simple plan. It states this in paragraph 2, \"A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan\". The last element of an ideal tragedy is that it should have a well constructed plot that is single in its issue. It says this in paragraph 3, \"A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain\". Aristotle liked to invoke human emotion in his writings and one of the ways he did this was by including these elements in his works.

On the top is pharaohs and gods, in the middle are citizens, and on the bottom is the serfs, or slaves.  These social classes, according to the text, were because the pharaoh decided that this should be done to protect their land. slaves were set to work to assist in case of a famine. This also applies to the medium level citizens.

First they had the pharaoh, they were thought to be gods and were treated like gods. Next we have nobles and priests, the nobles where known to give gifts to the gods but so did all Egyptians. The priests were responsible for pleasing the gods. Then we have the soldiers which they fought in the war and when they had peace they would supervise the peasants, farmers, and slaves. Then we have the middle class which were physicians and craftsmen. The  craftmen were also women and they sell jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, and other useful things. Finally we have the lowest class of them all the slaves and farmers. The slaves were prisoners of war and were forced to work on projects. The farmers tended to the fields raised animals, and kept canals. Moving up the the social ladder was not impossible but was difficult.

The change of fortune moves neither pity nor fear, but it shocks the audience.  A plot would help satisfy the moral sense but it would inspire nor pity nor fear.  The character type like Oedipus and Thyestes demonstrates highly renowned and prosperous men.

They should make a huge mistake which leads to their downfall.

His experiment was a success and he was ble to show others how people can gain control and use it for bad things.","6396":"In paragraph 4 it says \"but a man could run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of the dried dung of rats. These rats were nuisances, and the packers would put poisoned bread out for them; they would die, and then rats, bread, and meat would go into the hoppers together.\" Which means that they were putting rats in the hoppers along with a bunch of other things.","6397":"The ancient Egyptian system of government is shaped like a triangle. The gods were on the top, then a Pharaoh, who they believed were gods in human form. They were to do many responsibilities, including protecting. Next, is the vizier, who helps rule. Then, there were the nobels. They held government positions. On the same level, there are the priests, who pleased gods. Then, there are the soldiers who fought. Then there are the farmers and slaves. According to paragraph 1, it states, \"Egrptian society is structured like a pyramid.\" This means, the higher up, the more power you have. In total, people with more rule or power are greater on the triangle. ","6398":"The author is telling us how horrible this factory was by stating their vile practices not only towards their meat but their workers as well. This was a result of the combination of many immigrants in the United States to pursue a better life, and the fact that many big industries were looking for ways to maximize their profit. This sausage factory took old rotten meat and added toxic chemicals too it without anyone knowing and mixed it with meat that wasnt old and sold it to resturants and stores. Stated in paragraph 5 \"Every spring they did it; and in the barrels would be dirt and rust and old nails and stale water- and cartload after cartload of it would be taken up and dumped into the hoppers with fresh meat and sent out to the public's breakfest\"","6399":"The ancient Egyptian system of government is the nobles, priests, and viziers. The nobles were involved in the government by they were the only ones that could hold government posts. The priest were the ones who were responsible for pleasing the gods. The viziers ensured that taxes were collected.","6400":"The factory would use pickles and chemicals to cover up spolied meat. The text states \"Jonas, who had worked in the pickle rooms, they could now study the whole of the spoiled-meat industry on the inside\" (Paragraph 1). There were designated people who who use pickles to cover up the meat spoilage and they studied other options too. Another thing the text said was \"by plunging this needle into the meat and working with his foot, a man could fill a ham with pickle in a few seconds.\" (Paragraph 2). They injected ham with pickle juice in order to keep it from going bad but they would soon realize that this would make the odor terrible.","6401":"Ancient Egypt is divided into different classes. These classes are called \"Social Classes.\" Social Classes are seen as a pyramid. At the top of it all were the gods and pharaoh. Just below them are the nobles and priests. Skilled workers such as physicians and craftsmen\/women made the up middle class. At the bottom of it all there were slaves and farmers.","6402":"Tragedy should be the plot of a man that is neither good nor evil whose life falls apart because of a mistake or bad situation.

It should take the audience really feel for the  tragic hero. Secondly, in a tragedy, a bad man should never go from adversity to proseperity, due to the fact that it would inspire anger instead of pity or fear. Another elemenet of tragedy is to never fully vanquish the villain, becuase that satsifies the moaral sense too much to inspire any type of pity.","6404":"It was quick to progress because its common human instinct to follow crowds and have a sense of superiority. It was ended to show the students who were involved how horrible they can be.","6405":"According to the first sentence of paragraph two, workers would rub soda on pickled meat to take away the smell. Rotton meat was also pumped full of what seems to be pickle juice. If the meat was bad and had a horrible smell from the first round of pickle juice, workers were instructed to use more. This process was known as \"giving them thirty per cent\". Rotton meat was also dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption according to paragraph 3.","6406":"    The third wave was an experiment in 1967 that was developed in Palo Alto, California by Ron Jones. He conducted this experiment because he was unable to explain to his students how people throughout history followed the crowed when terrible things were happening. He developed the experiment by enforcing strict classroom disipline. Some of the rules were the students had to stand up to ask or answer questions and they had to do it in three words or fewer, and were required to begin each remark with \"Mr. Jones\". On the fourth day of the experiment Mr. Jones had to end the experiment because he felt that it was slipping out of control. The students were very   involved with the experiment and demostrated how people create a sense of  superiority over others, and how it can lead to people doing horrible things in the name of the state's honor.","6407":"The pharaohs had all the power in Egypt, and the nobles and priests also had a lot of power and wealth because of donations, the text states \u00a8 Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests.\u00a8 The soldiers, merchants, scribes, craftmens, storekeepers, artisans, traders, and physicians didnt have a lot of power or wealth, but they are still well off, unlike the farmers and slaves at the bottom of the social structure.

Their leaders, called pharaohs, were believed to be gods in human form. They had absolute power over their subjects. After pharaohs died, huge stone pyramids were built as their tombs. Pharaohs were buried in chambers within the pyramids.","6412":"Aristotle describes the ideal tragedy as a story in which a mundane character who is neither righteous nor evil  and experieneces  an unfortunate event caused by their own misjudgement, in essence Aristotle writes that the perfect tragedy should elicite both pity and fear.  Aristotle writes, \"there remains, then, the character between these two extremes \u2014 that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty\" (2) explaining how when writing a tragedy one must follow a  balanced character who causes their own downfall through a relatable means. Additionally the ideal tragedy must \"imitate actions which excite pity and fear\" (2) so that the viewer both sympathizes with the character and fears that they too could suffer the same fate. ","6413":"Their were plent of ways the factory would use or cover up spoiled meat. In paragraph 2 the meat that was taken out of pickle would be rubbed with soda if it was found sour. Again in paragraph 2 another way to cover up this abomination would be too pump the packers with a stronger pickle which destroyed the odor known as \"giving them thirty percent\". The last way I wanna talk about is when the whole ham was spoiled and would be mixed with other meat. ","6414":"An ideal tragedy described by Aristotle should  make the reader feel pity and fear,  a down to earth main character, and a main character who  makes mistakes in judgement. Without these factors, the tragedy is not complex enough, and is too simple making it less of a tragedy more of a comedy.  Aristotle writes, \"It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear...   that of a man who is not eminently good and just... but by some error of judgement or frailty...\" Here, Aristotle writes that 3 elements he looks for in a tragedy. Thus, reinstating the fact that for an ideal tragedy he needs to feel pity or fear, a normal main character, and a main character who makes mistakes.

One of the many ways they would cover it all up is evidenced in the second paragraph stating \"the meat that was taken out of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell\", which essentially means they would jam pack the meat with a lot of chemicals. This is just one of the many awful ways the packers would cover up the spoiled meat.

Lastly, Aristotle also described the third element of change of fortune, as he said, \"The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad.\" He says that these 3 elements, along with others,  should create a \"perfect tragedy\".","6527":"A tragedy should have a stategic plot line, it should be able to be gussed by the audience, and it should be about someone who is not good or evil whos world falls apart because of a mistake.","6528":"Three elements of an ideal tragedy would include the chage of fortune from good to bad, have some great error\/frailty in a charcter, and are founded on the stroy of a few houses.

While the primary character or the hero within these pieces should be an individual which is situated between the two extremes of incredibly just an incredibly evil, they should be neither be the epitome of saintly and good while they should neither have their downfall be brought to them due to their depravity or vice which they possess and should instead occur due to their own frailty or a minute error of judgment or mistake, and they should be an individual which is both prosperous and renowned being well known and plentiful within their lives or be other individuals connected to families which are of this variety. As well as that the plot which is maintained by these works should possess a singular issue or complication which it is revolving around, and the alteration within the character's fortune should be from that of good to poor and it should not occur due to a vice they possess and instead due to an error within the character previously described or one which is even better than that, though never worse, and within these pieces, there is what people call a bad or unhappy ending.","6534":"It devoloped so quickly because of the class.

Aristotle talks about how a character should not be a bad man or virtuos man, but a man in between those two extremes. A man who is not eminently good and just, yet their downfall is caused byerror of judgement or frailty. Some examples are Oedupis or Thyestes. This is because they are relatable to the viewers and pity or excitement can not be aroused  from simple adversity to prosperity or prosperity to adversity. Another key element is the plot. It should be a single plot where change of fortune should be from good to bad. Some of the greatest tragedies like the fortunes of Oedipus or Alcmaeon can back this up. Lastly, the ending is also a major facet of the ideal tragedy. Although the ending may not satisfy the viewers, if done right, it can be the most tragic like Euripides.","6567":"The plot should be well constructed and not have two issues but one single one.

Aristotle says \"The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad.\" Aristotle argues that if the fortune changed from bad to good, then it wouldn't invoke any feelings of pity in us, as it wouldn't be considered a tragedy if a character's fortune increased throughout the play, as this would be a good thing. Aristotle also says a good tragedy should portray a character who is somewhere in the middle between being inherently good and inherently bad. He says \"There remains, then, the character between these two extremes - that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty.\" Essentially, Aristotle is saying that the main character shouldn't be too good, as this wouldn't invoke any pity, however, the character also shouldn't be too evil, or else the audience wouldn't feel sorry for him and his bad misfortune. Lastly, Aristotle says a good tragedy should exhibit a character experiencing misfortune due to a flaw in his character, not necessarily because of bad or immoral behaviror. He says \"It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse.\" Overall, Aristotle argues that a good tragedy should portray a character who is neither good nor bad, but rather somewhere in the middle, who experiences a change of fortune from good to bad due to some inherent flaw of his character.

Evoking pity and fear from an audience are staples to a basic tragedy because such strong emotions practically entice the audience into the story; the audience may be able to see themselves in the story presented. The downfall of the story's villain in a tragedy should not be included because such event would only satisfy the audience and their moral sense. Pity and fear would not come from a villain's downfall because the evil had been defeated for the sake of what is \"good\" in the story. The main character of a tragedy should be balanced because their grey morality in views has the audience wonder if theiractions were deserving of such misfortune. It incites pity for the main character due to the main character not being wholly bad, just that their errors in judgement sadly brought them to misfortune.","6606":"An ideal tradegy, as described by Aristotle would consist of \"being arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan\", \"it should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic immitation\", and \"it neither satisfies the moral sense nor calls forth pity or fear\", ","6607":"They would use pickles to get rid of the spoiled meat smell, and they would also use the spoiled meat again but in forms of sausage or canned meat,","6608":"Conformity was possibly a key factor in many students joining the Third Wave.

Aristotle concludes, \"A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan. It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation.\"  Due to this, Aristotle indicates how tragedies should be deeply thought out to provide an emotional experience in a reader.  Furthermore, a second aspect is how the changes throughout the plot will lead to a downfall of a character or event.  He demonstrates that the change should be \"not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad.\"  Moreover, a third aspect of a tragedy is that the plot and storyline should follow one strict and sole storyline that will lead to the eventual negative outcome.  Aristotle suggests, \"A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain.\"  To summarize, 3 elements of a tragedy from Aristotle are strong emotions stirring in a reader, the defeat of a major character or events in the plot, and one plotline that strictly follows the issue of this story until the tragic ending.","6655":"One element of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle, is actions which move pity or fear.

When Aristole says this, he means that there should be actions that entertain pity, fear, and bring in the \"tragic\" part of the writing. There has to be a bundle of emotions to make the audience feel a certain way for the character. In the chapter from Poetics, Aristotle also states, \"A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issure, rather than double as some maintain\" (Paragraph 3). This means that there should be a plot that goes from good to bad. This provides an emotional connection to the character with their successes, but as the \"bad\" part comes in, you wil feel for the character. In the chapter from Poetics,  Aristotle states, \"It is accounted the best because of the weakness of the speactator; for the poet is guided in what he writes by the wishes of his audience\" (Paragraph 4). If you write the ending in the audiences wishes, they will be more intrigued. It's in the best wishes that the poet ends the writing in the audiences wishes, it will result in pleasure.

The Third Wave was just meant to be an experiment for Mr. Jones's class to understand how easy it is to enforce an idea on someone and make them believe and continue to spread it.

This sets the stage for the hero to have tragic flaws. The flaws allow the reader to see the hero for what they are. Because of this insight they can sympathize wiht the hero. And lastly the reversal of fortune is the tragic part of the story. With the reader sympathizing wiht the hero the reversal of fate becomes tragic to the reader.

In the example given, Aristotle says, ''...such plays, if well worked out, are the most tragic in effect'' said in paragraph 4.","6855":"The third wave had signeifcantly developed over a short period of time. The students eventually became overly involved in the project which led to Mr.Jones feeling out of control. This is shown when the text states that \" All of the students were issued a member card and each of them recieved a special assignment.\" This is illustartes how the students became immerced in the experiment even leading to reporting whenever one of their classmates would break a rule. The extreme loyalty and dicipline made Mr.Jones feel the need to terminate the movement and told the students they were apart of an experiment.

He Started this experiment called The Third Wave in april of 1967 and it went on for three days and it ended on the fourth because he realized that it was becoming too hard to handle and it was slipping out of his control. He started the experiment because he found it hard to explain what is called herd behavior and how much power a dictator can have alone over so many people. So he then created an authoritative dictatorship in his classroom to teach his students the German\u2019s mentality. He then made many rules to go along with the dictatorship like the students have to stand up while participating in class etc.. The text in paragraph 1 states \u201cHistory teacher Ron Jones, finding himself unable to explain to his students how people throughout history followed the crowd even when terrible things were happening, decided to demonstrate it to his students through an experiment.\u201d This shows how and why he started the experiment and how it was hard to explain these things to his students.

According to the text, Aristotle states that \"It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation\" (para 2). This would mean that an ideal tragedy would essentially evoke extreme emotions, like pity or fear from the audience, but not merely indicate a change in fortune of a person from good to bad that does not cause any significant reaction from the audience. The second element of a tragedy, as mentioned, there should be a reversal in fate going from good to bad and not from bad to good. An additional detail should include the idea that the misfortune causing a person to go from \"prosperity to adversity\" (para 2) should be \"unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like oursleves\" (para 2). This means that the misfortune should be in a manner that the person suffering the misfortune does not necessarily deserve it. Only then is it thought that pity or fear will be evoked to be considered as an ideal or effective tragedy. The third element of an ideal tragedy is the misfotrune coming about due to \"some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse\" (para 3). This would mean that there should be some error either caused by the person receiving the misfortune or by the part of some surrounding error. As a result, the error should lead to the misfortune as a whole and in turn evoke fear and pity from the audience.

Another method was mentioned in paragraphs 2 and 3 where the spoiled meats would be reused and repurposed as in other forms such as sausages. He also mentions the chemicals such as \"dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption.\" These methods were not healthy or of good quality. ","6870":"The first  one is character. As described by Aristotle the character shouldn't be overly good or overly bad, it would have to rather be \"one who is highly renowned and prosperous\". The second element of tragedy would be the plot because the fortune should from good to bad, not bad to good. This makes the viewer relate more to the character. The last element of an ideal tragedy would be Diction or the character's thoughts. This is the way that the characters express themselves and show their feelings.  The way they express their emotions can affect the viewer's  perspective on the plot. It could affect them by showing signs of grief or pity.","6871":"The factory would often use soda and other chemicals to cover up meat that had become sour. Many hams that were found spoiled even after this previous practice were injected with another type of pickling agent. The text describes the factory's practice, saying, \"...had a second and much stronger pickle which destroyed the odor - a process known...as 'giving them thrity per cent' \" (Sinclair).  Spoiled meats with bones soon became Number One Grade due to the industry's method of extracting the bone and practice where workers would \"insert into the hole a white-hot iron\" (Sinclair).","6872":"The Egyptain government could be metaphoricly like resembly their prymids.

The text states, \"They had absolute power over their subjects.\" The next level consisted of soldiers, craftsmen, and women. the text states, \"Skilled workers such as physicians and craftsmen\/women made up the middle class.\" The final layer of the prymid was the bottom layer that was made up of slaves and farmers.

As everyone follows the other, the group continues to grow until the amount is too large to control. The teacher stopped the expiriment because there were too many followers and too many of them were encouraging people to joining or forcing them by bullying until submission.","6874":"In the meatpacking industry, the workers would use certain methods, such as taking the bones out of rotten ham or pickling the ham to reduce the odor.  Sinclair states that \"some ingenious person had hit upon a new device\" where they would \"extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay\" in order to get rid of grades for the meats (Sinclair 2). Even though a bad part of the meat was being extracted, the way it was done was still unsanitary and it was used as a scheme by the meatpacking industry to appeal to the greater population. The meatpacking industry found another way to increase productivity by \"fill[ing] a ham with pickle in a few seconds\" through the process of using a \"needle into the meat and working with his foot\" in order to make the meat last longer, even at the cost of ruining its sanitation (Sinclair 2). The fact that the workers would use their feet in the process indicated how the meatpacking industry was corrupt when it came to providing sanitary ham's to the population and that it would find any way possible to increase productivity and cover-up spoiled meat. In Excerpt From The Jungle by Upton Sinclair, light is shed on the corrupt practices of the meat industry as they would taken the bones out of rotten ham and pickle ham to reduce the odor in attempts to cover it up from the rest of the population.","6875":"The three elements of an ideal tragedy according to Aristotle are a normal character with some challenges, a plot that goes from bad to good and a shocking ending. A normal charcter cannot be too evil or too good. He cannot be too fortunate, or too poor to where the audience already feels pity for them. They need to have something unfortunate happen to them. A tragedy's plot should go from good to bad, leaving that tragic feeling at the end. The audience will be unhappy after. Similar to the final element, an ending that leaves the audience shocked. The audience could not predict the ending, for there was a good and bad outcome. ","6876":"    In paragraph 2, it states that \"the meat was taken out of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell\". This was one of the ways in which the factory would cover up spoiled meat, because they would attempt to disguise the smell of the meat. In paragraph 3 it states \"when the whole ham was spoiled that it came into the department of Elzbieta. Cut up by the two-thousand-revolutions- a-minute flyers, and mixed with half a ton of other meat, no odor that ever was in a ham could make any difference\". This shows yet another way in which the factory would use spoiled meat, by cutting it up so that fresh meat could be mixed with a small amount of the spoiled meat, thus disguising the spoiled meat. In paragraph 4, it also states that \"There would be meat that had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and sawdust, where the workers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption germs. There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms; and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of rats would race about on it\".

All of these people listened to Jones and did exactly what he said and they weren't exactly thinking much of it.  When he introduced the salute signal non of the students said no to it and they all did it, \"Jones made up a salute resembling that of the Nazi regime and ordered class members to salute each other even outside the class.  They all obeyed this command.\" Clearly they replicated what occured with the Nazis without even knowing they were doing it.  This shows how out of hand the experiemtn got and it could have gotten worse if it was continued.  However Jones thought it was appropriate to end the experiment.

Scribes kept important governemnt documents, Priests where in charge of pleasing the gods, Nobles held certain government posts, and the greatest of all, Pharoes, where thought to be the ruler and or god of the land. \"All Egyptians-from pahroes to farmers-gave gifts to the gods.\" Although some roles might have higher value than others, all people give gifts to the gods.

Jones started his classes with strict disiplinary rules, improving all of their orderliness. He tested his students as more of them began to join, by creating a solute that resembled the Nazi regime, and a cathcy motto.  All of the students were showing herd behavior. Brfore long, more and more students began to join, following the lead of their fellow classmates. By the end, the experiment became out of control, because students were getting too involved with the movement. Jones decided to end the experiment, and tell his students that none of it was real.","7157":"Aristotle believed that the ideal tradegy should include the purgative power of tragedy and makes moral ambiguity the essence of tragedy. A perfect tragedy he says, should imitate actions that excite \u201cpity and fear.\u201d  A perfect tragedy should be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan.","7158":"The society of ancient Egypt was shaped like a pyramid. I think this because when I read this text it talked about how the gods were on the top, the pharaohs were right below the gods and the slaves, nobles, priests, women, craftsmen and more were at the middle and bottom. The reason I think this is because when all of them are stacked it forms a pyramid because there are more slaves, nobles, priests, women, and craftsmen then there are gods and pharos. So there are more people in the middle and bottom than there are on top.","7159":"The ancient Egyptian system was structured like a pyramid. The gods were at the top mainly because they were \"believed that the gods controlled the universe\", as said in paragraph one. At the bottom were slaves and farmers. They were the weakest of all humans. The slaves were \"forced to work on building projects\", (paragraph 13) like pyramids. In conclusion, the Egyptian system was structured like a pyramid, the strongest at the top and the weakest at the bottom.","7160":"They used all sorts of chemical concoctions to make the meat seem fine, as shown in this quote, \"also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose.\"  This quote shows just how much power they had in the manipulation of people and meat.","7161":"The lowest classes are slaves and farmers slaves being people taken from war and farmers pay a huge tax. The middle class was the craftsmen and craftswomen and the physicians. The higher class was the  Nobles, Scribes, Pharaoh's, Soldiers and the Preist. ","7162":"           they sorta made people start working on the structour theyed barley got paid.if they didget payed it was barley half of they actually had to get. one good ting is that the vizier's learned ho to read & write thats a really rare skill to masterin ainceint egypt.","7163":"An ideal tragety has three elements that make it ideal. To start a great tragedy must start with a great man and story, then to follow with a great twist or massive change in events. Lastly a great tragedy can be so good that in the end the man comes full circle and ends up with a good ending.","7164":"The meat would smell sour but the would \"rub it up with soda to take away the smell\" and they then would sell this rotting meat.  Hams would be found spoiled after being pickled so they would pump it with a \"stronger pickle\" to make the odor go away.  They would sell ham that they had taken the bone out of and use a white hot iron to be sold a s a boneless ham.
